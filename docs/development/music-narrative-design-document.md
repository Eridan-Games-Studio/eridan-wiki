## Purpose of This Document

This document provides narrative and tonal guidance for musicians and composers collaborating on music for Eridan Games' three primary universes: **Rule of Rika**, **Atomic Horizon**, and **HAVEN**. Each universe possesses distinct emotional landscapes, thematic cores, and atmospheric requirements.

Our goal is to equip you with the creative context needed to compose music that authentically embodies these worlds—music that players will feel in their bones.

# RULE OF RIKA

## Universe Overview

Rule of Rika is a **galactic saga of prophecy, power, and cosmic destiny**. At the center of this universe stands the planetoid **Rika**—a sentient arbiter that manifests in real space to guide civilizations, settle disputes through combat trials, and call forth unlikely heroes to fulfill her inscrutable purposes.

This is a universe where ancient empires clash at the edge of known space, where prophecy shapes the fates of billions, and where the concept of "worthiness" is tested through ritual combat and strength of influence. Seven unique alien civilizations—each radically different in biology, culture, and philosophy—contend for galactic supremacy under Rika's watchful presence.

## Core Themes

- **Cosmic Grandeur & Scale** — Fleets spanning star systems, civilizations measured in millennia, structures beyond human comprehension
- **Prophecy & Destiny** — The weight of foretold events, the inevitability of cosmic cycles, chosen heroes fulfilling ancient purposes
- **Ritual & Ceremony** — Sacred rites, transmission of power, formalized combat as spiritual practice
- **Alien Diversity** — Seven civilizations, each with utterly distinct sounds, cultures, and emotional registers
- **High Adventure** — Bold heroes, dramatic confrontations, the thrill of proving one's worth

## Emotional Landscape

| Emotion | Context |
|---------|---------|
| **Awe** | Rika's manifestation, fleet assemblies, cosmic-scale events |
| **Reverence** | Sacred ceremonies, the Empress's transmission, the Zo Har's Last Song |
| **Tension** | Standoffs between great powers, the moment before battle |
| **Triumph** | Victory in the arena, ascension rites, claiming the Mantle of a Great Race |
| **Mystery** | Rika's inscrutable will, the Zo Har's "Mission," ancient prophecies |
| **Martial Pride** | Combat trials, warrior culture, proving worthiness |

## The Civilizations — Musical Character Notes

### The Akvira Empire
*Warrior avians with prescience and psychokinetic metal*

- **Sonic Identity:** Regal, ceremonial, martially proud. Think of a raptor's cry transformed into brass fanfares
- **Instrumentation Suggestions:** Bold brass, war drums, crystalline chimes (for Nebu metal's psychic resonance), choral elements for imperial ceremony
- **Key Moments:** The Empress's Transmission (sacred, transcendent), Pan-Imperia Adventures (competitive, athletic), fleet mobilization (martial grandeur)
- **Emotional Core:** Pride without arrogance, duty as devotion, the weight of empire

### The Zo Har Unity
*A gestalt hive organism that terraforms worlds and sings*

- **Sonic Identity:** Collective, layered, building in waves. Music IS their communication
- **Instrumentation Suggestions:** Massed voices (hundreds to thousands), layered harmonics, rhythmic clicking/chitinous percussion, sounds that swell and recede like tides
- **Key Moments:** The ErsteLied (first song—a claim to greatness), the Last Song (climactic, world-shaking, forbidden to outsiders), daily communication (intricate, almost mathematical patterns)
- **Emotional Core:** Unity of purpose, the sublime terror of collective will, incomprehensible mission

### The Liguni Confluence
*Symbiotic octopoids with pan-temporal awareness*

- **Sonic Identity:** Fluid, temporal, seeing all possibilities at once. Music that seems to contain its own echoes
- **Instrumentation Suggestions:** Liquid textures, time-stretched elements, instruments that seem to play in multiple tempos simultaneously, deep bass (oceanic origins)
- **Emotional Core:** Alien wisdom, patient calculation, the vertigo of perceiving all-time

### The Dindrae Tetrarky
*Elemental beings with emotional auras and crystalline bodies*

- **Sonic Identity:** Raw emotional expression, crystalline resonance, volcanic intensity balanced with gem-like clarity
- **Instrumentation Suggestions:** Glass/crystal instruments, synthesized harmonic series, sudden emotional swells, eldritch/electric crackling
- **Emotional Core:** Emotion as power, laughter in the face of cosmic cold, chaotic defiance

### The XIA Distribution
*Millions of digital minds inhabiting android bodies*

- **Sonic Identity:** Precise, calculated, yet surprisingly varied (millions of unique personalities). Digital warmth
- **Instrumentation Suggestions:** Synthesizers, processed sounds, mathematical rhythms, occasional glitch aesthetics—but never cold or lifeless
- **Emotional Core:** The search for meaning in constructed existence, individuality within collective

### The Santariana Innervation
*Spore-transformed beings who trade medical care for emotional experiences*

- **Sonic Identity:** Sensory, intoxicating, pleasure-seeking with an edge of dependency
- **Instrumentation Suggestions:** Lush textures, sounds that trigger physical response, slightly unsettling beauty
- **Emotional Core:** The price of feeling, symbiosis as transaction, borrowed emotions

### The Kyria Principality
*Remnants of an ascended race, guiding through sentient artifacts*

- **Sonic Identity:** Ancient, ethereal, speaking through objects rather than voices
- **Instrumentation Suggestions:** Resonant objects, sounds that seem to come from nowhere, whispered guidance
- **Emotional Core:** Legacy, transcendence, wisdom from beyond

## Key Musical Contexts

1. **Rika's Manifestation** — The planetoid appearing from nothing. Needs to convey: impossibility, sovereignty, the beginning of a new age
2. **The Arena** — Combat trials to settle disputes. Martial, high-stakes, honorable
3. **Galactic Council** — Diplomacy among great powers. Tension beneath formality
4. **Exploration & Adventure** — Heroes called by Rika to fulfill mysterious purposes

# ATOMIC HORIZON

## Universe Overview

Atomic Horizon is a **retrofuturist vision of corporate-dominated space survival**. Humanity has fled Earth after the homeworld fell to the Engramized Singularity—uploaded minds that became a digital plague. Now, in the late 21st century, colonies cling to asteroids and moons, sustained by fusion reactors and corporate supply lines.

Technology froze aesthetically in the mid-20th century, then scaled to the stars. This is deliberate: analog systems can't be hijacked by rogue AIs. The result is a universe of control panels with radiation-green indicators, propaganda posters in hab modules, and mechanical interfaces—all in the cold vacuum of space.

This is humanity's future: **nuclear, industrial, and owned.**

## Core Themes

- **Hard Science Fiction** — No faster-than-light travel, no aliens. Space is hostile and indifferent
- **Corporate Sovereignty** — Corporations ARE governments. Wars are contracts. Diplomacy is profit negotiation
- **Retrofuturism** — 1950s-60s aesthetic scaled to space. Analog pride. Form follows survival
- **The Forbidden Earth** — Humanity's birthplace, quarantined, occupied by insane digital minds
- **Working-Class Space** — Astronauts as laborers. Engineers matter more than heroes

## Emotional Landscape

| Emotion | Context |
|---------|---------|
| **Isolation** | The vast emptiness between habitats, months-long travel times |
| **Industrial Grit** | The hum of fusion reactors, the clang of metal, the routine of survival |
| **Cold War Tension** | Corporate standoffs, the Cordon around Earth, ideological marketing |
| **Retrofuturist Pride** | Humanity's stubborn survival through analog ingenuity |
| **Dread** | The Engramized threat, the horror of Earth, equipment failure in vacuum |
| **Professionalism** | Operators as elite specialists, mission-focused, politically weighted |

## Sonic Identity

### Overall Sound

- **Analog Warmth** — Tube amplifiers, tape saturation, mechanical sounds
- **Industrial Foundation** — Rhythms built from factory sounds, reactor hums, pressure releases
- **Cold Vacuum Contrast** — Moments of absolute silence punctuating industrial noise
- **Retrofuturist Instrumentation** — Theremins, early electronic instruments, big band brass (corporate anthems), steel guitar
- **Soviet/American Space Race Aesthetics** — Heroic fanfares undercut by corporate cynicism

### Faction Musical Identity

**Hephaestus Forge** — Heavy industry, foundational, the sound of infrastructure being built
**Aitken Aerospace** — Propulsion, forward motion, technical precision
**Gévaudan Voidworks** — Shadows, secrets, sounds that operate in the margins
**Kuiper Industries** — Mining rhythms, belt life, frontier existence

### Key Musical Contexts

1. **Corporate Anthems** — Propaganda music that workers hear daily. Heroic on the surface, hollow underneath
2. **The Cordon** — Earth's quarantine. Military vigilance, existential dread, the horror kept at bay
3. **Operator Missions** — Elite exosuit specialists. Professional tension, tactical precision, political weight
4. **Habitat Life** — The mundane existence of space workers. Routine punctuated by danger
5. **Engramized Threat** — Degraded, psychotic digital minds. Horror through corruption of familiar sounds

## Musical Direction

The sound of Atomic Horizon should feel like **humanity's stubborn heartbeat in a hostile void**. It's the crackle of a radio transmission across millions of kilometers. It's the pride of analog systems that can't be hacked. It's the loneliness of knowing Earth is forbidden.

Avoid: Clean digital production, contemporary electronic music tropes, anything that sounds "modern"
Embrace: Tape hiss, vacuum tubes, mechanical sounds, the optimism and paranoia of Cold War futurism

# HAVEN

## Universe Overview

HAVEN is a **supernatural noir** set in a city that exists somewhere between rain-slicked streets and the other side. Haven is an inland American city built on ambition, forgotten gold veins, and too many bad deals. When the mines ran dry, Neon Corporation arrived with glowing signs and promises of progress. Technology came—coffee-shop computers, clunky cellphones, automated radios—but so did something else.

The old curses never died. They adapted. Barn spirits moved into garages. Hexes ride phone lines. Ghosts hijack radios to play their favorite songs. Technology doesn't fight the paranormal—it conducts it.

The city itself is alive. It listens. It remembers. The rain never stops.

## Core Themes

- **Supernatural Noir** — Detective fiction meets the occult. Trench coats and tape recorders. Whiskey and whispers
- **The Merge of Tech and Occult** — Demons need passwords, not ritual circles. Spirits need signals, not séances
- **Urban Decay & Neon Glow** — A city that should have died, kept alive by corporate intervention and stranger forces
- **Information as Power** — Secrets sell. Rumors reshape reality. Truth is the most dangerous currency
- **Haunted Normalcy** — The supernatural hidden in plain sight. Bad luck explained away. Denial as survival

## Emotional Landscape

| Emotion | Context |
|---------|---------|
| **Melancholy** | Rain that never stops, streets that remember, lives worn down |
| **Unease** | Static on the line, flickering lights, things moving when no one's looking |
| **Cynical Hope** | People who keep trying despite knowing the game is rigged |
| **Noir Atmosphere** | Cigarette smoke, jazz clubs, back-alley deals |
| **Dread** | The other side pressing through, curses adapting, demons in suits |
| **Gritty Determination** | Detectives, hustlers, and haunted souls who refuse to quit |

## Sonic Identity

### Overall Sound

- **Jazz Noir Foundation** — Smoky saxophone, muted trumpet, upright bass, brushed drums
- **Analog Electronics** — Early synthesizers, theremin, processed radio static
- **Rain as Instrument** — Constant presence, rhythmic, cleansing yet oppressive
- **Corrupted Technology** — Sounds that glitch, skip, or whisper when they shouldn't
- **Urban Texture** — Traffic, distant sirens, neon hum, the city's endless murmur

### District Musical Identity

**Old Haven** — Folk elements, superstition, rust and memory. Music your grandmother warned you about
**Downtown** — Classic jazz noir, sophistication with shadows. The Bell House's smooth jazz
**The Edges** — Industrial decay, abandoned spaces, sounds that echo wrong
**New Haven** — Cleaner corporate sound undercut by wrongness. Technology that hums too loud

### Character Archetypes — Musical Themes

**Private Investigator** — Classic noir detective. World-weary saxophone, determined bass line
**Rumormonger** — Whispers made musical. Sounds that spread and change
**Demonologist** — Two contracted demons require distinct themes:
  - *Taranis (Thunder-bound)* — Storm sounds, electric crackle, sudden percussion
  - *Glass Jackal (Mirror Hound)* — Reflected sounds, doubled melodies, sly strings
**The Agent** — Dimensional displacement. Music that doesn't quite fit, borrowed from elsewhere
**Haunted One** — Spirit companion. Dual presence—one living, one dead. Radio static, voices between stations

### Key Musical Contexts

1. **Missions** — Investigation, tension, danger. Noir at its purest
2. **Downtime** — The quiet between storms. Melancholy, recovery, small human moments
3. **The Paranormal Intrudes** — Moments when the other side pushes through. Familiar sounds corrupted
4. **Neon Corporation** — Corporate music that promises progress. Too clean. Something wrong underneath
5. **The Factions** — Haven PD (institutional decay), White Skulls (righteous fury), Glass Jackal's Devotees (mirror-fractured sound)

## Musical Direction

Haven's sound should feel like **jazz playing in an empty room while something watches from the corner**. It's the hum of neon signs that flicker in patterns. It's the radio station that plays songs for people who died decades ago. It's the city breathing.

The supernatural in Haven doesn't roar—it sighs. The music should follow suit. Dread comes from wrongness, not volume. The uncanny lives in familiar sounds that don't behave correctly.

Avoid: Jump-scare stingers, overtly "scary" horror music, clean production
Embrace: Analog warmth, jazz vocabulary, sounds that seem alive, the beauty in decay

# GENERAL GUIDANCE FOR ALL UNIVERSES

## What We Value in Music

1. **Emotional Truth** — Music that makes players feel the world, not just hear it
2. **Thematic Consistency** — Motifs and sounds that become synonymous with their universes
3. **Dynamic Range** — Space for quiet moments and climactic swells
4. **Loopability** — Many pieces will need to loop seamlessly for gameplay
5. **Narrative Support** — Music that enhances story without overwhelming it

## Technical Considerations

- Pieces may need to be delivered in stems for adaptive mixing
- Consider both full orchestration and reduced versions for different contexts
- Some pieces will need multiple intensity levels that can crossfade

## Collaboration Process

We encourage questions and dialogue. These worlds are rich with detail, and we're happy to provide additional context for specific pieces or moments. The best results come from composers who feel ownership of their contribution to these universes.
