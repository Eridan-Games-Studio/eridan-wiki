# World Building

Our approach to world-building creates immersive universes that feel lived-in, complex, and authentic.

## Methodology

### Deep Cultural Design
Each civilization in our worlds isn't just a collection of traits—it's a **fundamentally different way of existing**. We design cultures from the ground up, considering:

- **Biology**: How physical form shapes technology and society
- **Cognition**: How different minds perceive and process reality
- **Economics**: How resources and trade function in alien contexts
- **Politics**: How power structures emerge from unique cultural values
- **Technology**: How tools and systems develop organically from biology and culture

### Layered Narrative Structure
Our worlds operate on multiple levels simultaneously:

- **Surface Level**: What players immediately encounter
- **Cultural Level**: The deeper meanings and traditions
- **Cosmic Level**: The grand cycles and transcendent purposes
- **Meta Level**: How different perspectives create conflicting truths

### Ritual and Belief Systems
In our universes, belief isn't abstract—it's **functional**. Rituals actively shape reality, myths serve as operating systems, and cultural practices have measurable effects on the world.

## The Rule of Rika

### Alien Perspectives
Each race in The Rule of Rika represents a completely different approach to existence:
- **Biology as Technology**: Physical form determines capabilities
- **Cognition as Culture**: How minds work shapes how societies function
- **Reality as Belief**: What you believe determines what's possible

### Cosmic Cycles
The universe operates on grand scales where civilizations compete for Ascension—the right to transcend mortality and join the godlike Guardians who shape reality.

### Rika's Influence
The sentient planetoid Rika serves as cosmic judge and guide, offering deliberately inscrutable wisdom that drives galactic politics and individual quests.

## Atomic Horizon

### Corporate Sovereignty
Earth's collapse elevated corporations into ruling powers, each with:
- **Territorial Claims**: Control over specific regions and resources
- **Military Forces**: Corporate armies and security operations
- **Economic Systems**: Unique currencies and trade relationships
- **Cultural Identities**: Distinct corporate cultures and values

### Retrofuturist Aesthetic
Technology froze aesthetically in the mid-20th century, then scaled to the stars. This isn't just visual design—it's a security philosophy born from the Engramized Singularity.

### Hard Science Fiction
Space is treated realistically:
- **Radiation Hazards**: Constant threat from cosmic radiation
- **Resource Scarcity**: Everything must be manufactured or imported
- **Time Delays**: Communication and travel measured in months
- **Equipment Failure**: Technology breaks down in hostile environments

## H.A.V.E.N

### Urban Supernaturalism
The city itself is a character, with:
- **Living Streets**: Architecture that responds to supernatural forces
- **Occult Undercurrent**: Hidden symbols and forgotten rites
- **Paranormal Evidence**: Supernatural phenomena that can't be ignored
- **Corrupting Influence**: The city twists fate toward chaos

### Crime and Syndicates
Every aspect of life is touched by organized crime:
- **Territorial Control**: Gangs control specific neighborhoods
- **Economic Influence**: Crime shapes legitimate business
- **Political Corruption**: Syndicates infiltrate government institutions
- **Social Networks**: Everyone owes someone, creating complex webs of obligation

### Investigation Framework
The city rewards those who ask the right questions:
- **Hidden Truths**: Secrets that powerful people want to keep buried
- **Supernatural Mysteries**: Cases that defy rational explanation
- **Personal Stakes**: Investigations that threaten the investigator's own safety
- **Moral Complexity**: No clear heroes or villains, only shades of gray
