# Design Philosophy

At Eridan Games, we believe in creating immersive experiences that challenge players to think differently about the worlds they inhabit.

## Core Principles

### Deep Embodiment
Our worlds aren't just settings—they're **fundamentally different realities**. When you step into one of our universes, you don't just play a character; you undergo a profound transformation of perspective. Biology dictates technology, shapes society, and defines consciousness itself.

### Meaningful Choice
Every decision in our games carries weight. Whether you're navigating political intrigue in The Rule of Rika, surviving corporate warfare in Atomic Horizon, or investigating supernatural mysteries in H.A.V.E.N, your choices shape not just your character's fate, but the world around you.

### Collaborative Storytelling
We design games that empower players to become co-creators of the narrative. Our mechanics support creative problem-solving and imaginative storytelling, giving players the tools to craft their own unique experiences.

### Accessible Complexity
Our games offer deep strategic and narrative complexity while remaining accessible to new players. We believe sophisticated gameplay shouldn't require a steep learning curve.

## World-Building Approach

### Layered Truths
Each civilization in our universes holds its own viewpoint with unwavering authenticity. These conflicting truths create natural tensions with no simple resolution, encouraging players to piece together deeper patterns through exploration and discovery.

### Ritual as Reality
In our worlds, belief isn't just cultural backdrop—it's the fundamental code that runs the universe. Myths serve as operating systems, and rituals function as executable programs that actively rewrite reality.

### Cosmic Cycles
Our universes operate on grand scales where history pulses through cosmic cycles. Every action serves a higher purpose: proving your civilization worthy of transcending mortality and joining the ranks of godlike beings.

## Game Design Philosophy

### Asymmetric Balance
We create games where different factions or characters have fundamentally different playstyles, yet remain balanced through careful design. This asymmetry creates rich strategic depth and replayability.

### Emergent Narrative
Rather than forcing players down predetermined story paths, we create systems that generate emergent narratives through player choice and interaction.

### Physical Components
We believe in the power of tangible game elements to enhance immersion and create memorable experiences that extend beyond digital screens.
