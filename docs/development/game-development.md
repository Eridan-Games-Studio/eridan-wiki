# Game Development Process

Our development process is designed to create innovative, polished games that push the boundaries of tabletop gaming.

## Development Phases

### Concept Phase
- **World Building**: Deep dive into universe creation and lore development
- **Core Mechanics**: Establish fundamental gameplay systems
- **Target Audience**: Define player experience goals
- **Scope Definition**: Set realistic development timelines and resource requirements

### Prototype Phase
- **Rapid Iteration**: Quick prototyping of core mechanics
- **Playtesting**: Internal testing with development team
- **Mechanic Refinement**: Iterate based on early feedback
- **Art Direction**: Establish visual identity and component design

### Testing Phase
- **Alpha Testing**: Closed testing with select groups
- **Beta Testing**: Expanded testing with broader community
- **Balance Refinement**: Fine-tune gameplay based on extensive playtesting
- **Production Planning**: Finalize manufacturing and distribution logistics

### Production Phase
- **Final Artwork**: Complete all visual assets
- **Manufacturing**: Partner with production facilities
- **Quality Control**: Ensure consistent production quality
- **Distribution**: Coordinate launch across multiple platforms

## Quality Standards

### Playtesting Requirements
- Minimum 100+ hours of playtesting per game
- Testing across multiple player groups and skill levels
- Documentation of all feedback and iteration decisions
- Balance verification through statistical analysis

### Production Quality
- High-quality components and materials
- Clear, accessible rulebooks
- Professional artwork and graphic design
- Consistent manufacturing standards

### Accessibility
- Rules written for clarity and ease of understanding
- Multiple difficulty levels where appropriate
- Inclusive design principles
- Support for players with different needs

## Team Structure
