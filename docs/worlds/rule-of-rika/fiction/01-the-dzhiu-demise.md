# The DZHIU Demise

## The Arrival

When the day finally arrived, the DZHIU descended upon the Rika space area in all of their regal splendor.

Led by the revered savant **Arimnia CHA Derisendi Yo'h** aboard the magnificent flagship **Pride of DZHIU**, the fleet gathered around the **Solar Intum Drill**—a marvel of ingenuity called to best the strength of Rika through technological force, and thus win the position of ascendancy by showing greater prowess.

As the ships slowly coalesced behind the drill, a mesmerizing spectacle unfolded on the capitol's prime terrace:

- **Four armed dancers** moved to a primal beat
- Their **bright green skin** oiled with finest perfumes
- Clad in **glistening precious metals** that enticed onlookers with sultry allure

All over the capitol's manifold terraces, participants reveled in joy and adulterated revelry, feasting and drinking in anticipation of their impending victory.

## The Omen

But beneath their wide grins, and deep below the layers of imbibed elixirs, from the vestiges of some long-forgotten evolutionary ancestor, a **primal fear crept up like an uninvited guest**.

A mute messenger of terror, it slowly but surely tightened their elixir-soaked throats to warn them of impending doom.

But none wished to listen.

Even though atop their floating seats, **Rika's silent, royal presence** filled their landscape with splendor and their hearts with primordial awe. The Aranik shielding, vibrating in a pale blue hue, signaled Rika's deep, impenetrable sleep—completely uncaring for the DZHIU show of force.

For the grand savant, however, the cosmic night shone brightly with the promise of celestial glory.

She stood above her royal assembly on the transparent plateau, firm, tense, and regal with her self-absorbed value. The silken dress revealed her pale marble skin and perfect contour, her four arms busy with action, caressing the lovers beneath her feet.

For a prolonged moment she basked in her importance and stature, waiting for a crescendo—

And then, upon reaching the heights of her climactic focus, she exclaimed royally, and wildly, high above all other voices:

**"Into the breach!"**

With that fateful decision, wrapped in an exuberant whirlwind of laughter and shouts, the great engine was started and the Drill interfaced with the Aranik shielding.

## The Moment

For a breathless moment, nothing transpired.

Privily, a collective murmur of anticipation rose as the Engineers boosted the Drill's power to greater output. Another moment passed, and yet another.

All was still.

And then, the Aranik shield briefly, shyly, shimmered.

The crowd exploded in a jubilee of pride, embracing each other in wild revelry, sharing the firm belief of their imminent success.

But then the unimaginable occurred.

The Aranik shield, all in a single instant, in a blink of an eye, turned a **deep, ominous black**—a perfectly circular void amid twinkling stars.

And just as quickly, the void expanded.

Or was this merely a trick of the eye? None had the time to tell, for just in that single next instant, the shield was back to its white-blue color, as though nothing happened at all.

## The Realization

A sudden gasp grasped the DZHIU by their throats, the court swiftly falling under a cloak of utter silence.

*"The drill?"* came a single voice, trembling with anxiety, piercing the stillness of the royal chamber.

Someone started crying, frantically and inconsolably.

The grand savant, bewildered by the readings on her viewing screen, leaned over to her command deck with mad fury. The prince-engineer turned, his face completely devoid of color:

**"The drill...the fleet...they are gone!"**

And so it was.

Nothing was left of the drill, nor the accompanying ships—all were gone in a single instant, in a blink of an eye. The only two entities left, Rika and the flagship, now faced each other in solemn silence of space.

## The Epiphany

Slammed by this awareness, the grand savant staggered back—one, two, then three steps—and fell in her chair. Her eyes filled with tears, her lungs tightened to squeeze the last pockets of air.

And then, as though she could sense her terror, the Rika's shield became, again, a **perfect void**.

The capitol ship shuddered violently, its internal structure writhing, ensnared by unseen forces. Panic erupted, screams echoed through the halls as the desperate race for survival began toward the life pods.

Amidst the chaos, the grand savant stood motionless, silent. The tumultuous sounds seemed distant to her, as if she existed in a space separated from the cries of her lovers and the anguish of her people.

All she could see was the **ominous black eye of the Rika**, gazing back at her with otherworldly intensity.

And in that profound moment, as time stood still and a single tear traced its path down her cheek, the grand savant had her **epiphany**.

Everything unfurled before her:

- The profound wisdom of the Founders
- The intricately woven recursion of each Great Cycle
- The significance of the Players

All converged within this fateful revelation.

She now beheld the Rika for what she thought she truly was, and every fiber of her being quivered with a mix of awe and terror at the revelation of her folly.

But then, the capitol ship was rocked again, and yanked with force. The revered savant was left with no time to probe her death vision.

In an instant, all that was left of the grand DZHIU fleet moved toward the Rika and then, one by one, they disappeared and were no more.

---

So fell the DZHIU, the **first of the outcasts**.

> *"To disobey the Call is to disobey the Rika, and to disobey the Rika is a grave fate indeed."*
