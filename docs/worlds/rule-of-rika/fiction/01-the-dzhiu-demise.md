In that fated day, the **DZHIU** descended on the **Rika space** in all of their regal splendor.

Led by the revered savant **Arimnia CHA Derisendi Yo'h** aboard the flagship *Pride of DZHIU*, the entire fleet gathered around the **Solar Intum Drill**. A marvel of ingenuity, and a tool to defy fate, the drill was meant to be DZHIU’s final testament and the proof of their supremacy over all other races. Through it, they wished to best Rika’s impenetrable silence, and thus, in manifesting supremacy over Rika’s protective shielding, secure their position of ascendancy.

As the ships slowly positioned behind the drill, a mesmerizing spectacle unfolded on the capitol's prime terrace. Here, four armed dancers moved to a gentle but primal beat, their bright green skin oiled with finest perfumes and clad in glistening precious metals. All over the capitol’s floating terraces, participants reveled, feasting and drinking in anticipation of their impending show of supremacy.

But beneath their wide grins, and below the layers of imbibed elixirs, through the genetical vestiges of some long-forgotten ancestor, a **primal fear crept up like an uninvited guest**.
A mute messenger of terror, it tried to warn them of their folly. For Rika stood firmly and regally in front of them, her **Aranik shielding** vibrating in a pale blue hue, signaling her impenetrable sleep, uncaring for the show of force.

But, for the grand savant, the cosmic night shone brightly with the promise of celestial glory. She stood above her royal assembly on the transparent plateau, firm, tense, and regal with her self-absorbed value. Her silken dress revealing the marble pale skin and perfect contour, her four arms engrossed to caress the lovers beneath her feet. A moment passed and two, and then, with all eyes upon her, she exclaimed royally, and wildly, high above all other voices:

**"Into the breach!"**

And with that fateful decision, wrapped in an exuberant whirlwind of laughter and shouts, the great engine was started and the Drill interfaced with Rika’s Aranik shielding.

For a breathless moment, nothing transpired. Privily, a collective murmur of anticipation rose as the Engineers boosted the Drill’s power to greater output. Another moment passed, and yet another. All was still.

And then, the **Aranik shield** briefly, shyly, shimmered. The crowd exploded in a jubilee of pride, embracing each other in wild revelry, sharing the joy of their imminent success.

But then the unimaginable occurred. The Aranik shield, all in a single instant, in a blink of an eye, turned a deep, ominous black. A perfectly circular void amid twinkling stars. And just as quickly, the void expanded. Or was this merely a trick of the eye? None had the time to tell, for just in that single next instant, the shield was back to its white-blue color, as though nothing happened at all.

A sudden gasp grasped the DZHIU, their breath stolen; the court swiftly fell under a cloak of utter silence.

*"The drill?"* came a single voice, trembling with anxiety, piercing the stillness of the royal chamber. Someone started crying, frantically and inconsolably.

The grand savant, bewildered by the readings on her viewing screen, leaned over to her command deck with mad fury. The prince-engineer turned, his face completely devoid of color:

**“The drill…the fleet…they are gone!”**

And so it was, for nothing was left of the drill, nor the accompanying ships; all disappeared. And the only two entities left in the cosmic void, Rika and the flagship, now faced each other in the solemn silence of space.

The grand savant staggered back, one, two, then three steps, and fell in her chair. Her eyes filled up with tears, her lungs tightened to squeeze the last pockets of air. And then, as though sensing her terror, Rika’s Aranik shielding became, again, a perfect void.

The capitol ship shuddered violently, its internal structure writhing, ensnared by unseen forces. Panic erupted; screams echoed through the halls as the desperate race for survival began towards the life pods.

Amidst the chaos, the grand savant stood motionless, silent; the tumultuous sounds seemed distant to her, as if she existed in a space separated from the cries of her lovers and the anguish of her people.

All she could see was the **ominous black eye of the Rika**, gazing back at her with otherworldly intensity. And in that profound moment, as time stood still and a single tear traced its path down her cheek, the grand savant had her epiphany.


For, unbeknownst to her, the **DZHIU** carried a latent and very rare genetical imprint. One that triggered only in situations of highest civilizational peril, of existential dread. One to see beyond the veil of temporality and materiality. And so it was, that in the last moments of her life, the savant saw the transcendent truth.

The profound wisdom of the **Founders**, the intricately woven recursion of each **Great Cycle**, and the significance of the races —all converged within this fateful revelation.

She now beheld the **Rika** for what she thought she truly was, and every fiber of her being quivered with a mix of awe and terror at the revelation of her folly.

But then, the capitol ship was rocked again, and yanked with force. The revered savant was left with no time to probe her death vision. In an instant, all that was left of the grand DZHIU fleet moved towards the Rika and then, one by one, they disappeared and were no more.
