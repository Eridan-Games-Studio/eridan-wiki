# Prologue: Before the Rika

> *"Wait for her arrival and prove your worth in ages to come. The path awaits."*  
> — Ar Kharazon, Last Grand Vizjerei

Between the time when the Gorion star went supernova, and the Viconian dynasty drew its last breath, the Dominion Ascendancy, the last of the ancient guardians, ascended into the HenceForth.

In the wake of their transferal, etched into subspace, they left a single message. A galactic location and a voice, that of the last Grand Vizjerei, Ar Kharazon himself. With a tumultuous voice, he declared: **"Wait for her arrival and prove your worth in ages to come. The path awaits."**

Immediately, fully aware that the next Galactic Cycle had begun, the Titans of Power—the Liguni Confluence, the Akvira Empire, and the Dindrae Tetrarky—stormed upon the issued call with fervent haste. Fleets were assembled, alliances reforged, and borders fortified as all eyes in the galaxy turned to the same destined location.

## The First Convergence

The first to arrive were the Akvira and the Liguni. At first, they positioned fleets at a courteous distance respecting their common might and title. But as the days passed, so did patience. A galactic week into the foray, their fleets steadily approached the central perimeter, and with each passing step, the wings of war cast an ominous shadow over the sector.

But even amid such growing hostilities, the Chancellors, trained to impact the will, gave their utmost to sway the opponent and win through influence. At first, appeals were made. But these soon gave way to bribes and offers of trade. And when these failed, threats and extortions followed. But still, with each argument, with each bribe and offer a small progress was made. And after days of effort, it seemed as though a well-placed treaty could be established.

## The Dindrae Intervention

But then, unexpectedly, the Dindrae Tetrarky obdurately warped their mountain cities directly between the two forces and triumphantly declared the dawn of the **"Imune"** era and their solemn right to command the area.

The first to react was the Akvira, aggravated by such insolent behavior, their fleets sprang to full combat status. Destroyers and fighters were now enveloped in Nebu Shielding as kinetic guns accelerated to full power. The Liguni, thinking in all-time, responded in equal measure. Their base stars, enveloped in clouds of black organo-ink, spun toward the zone's center with deadly intent.

The Dindrae, backing their words with power, raised high the crystal spires, tops crackling with eldritch lightning. Underneath them, their monstrous forms littered the surface of the mountain polis. Each one hastening towards their positions unfazed by the cosmic cold, or fear, laughing.

## The Zo Har Arrival

At the point of highest tension, and without a word of warning the bioflux conduits of the Zo Har burst forth from the subspace strata, their anchor ships solidifying the curvature of space as the migration fleet poured like a tidal wave into the unoccupied space.

And when the Zo Har came, they came singing. With a multitude of voices, the grand Zo Har chorus sang its **ErsteLied** for the first time in galactic history, overwhelming all stellar communications and for a moment pacifying the entirety of fleet hostility.

The Akvira, Liguni, and Dindrae ships immediately froze in their tracks, not daring to fulfill their hostile intentions. For as all knew, this mighty act was the fulfillment of the ancient rite of Holmgang and a successful claim to the Mantle of a Great Race.

And so it came to be, that in a still, hushed reverence, not one, two, or three but **four Great Races** interlocked their intentions in the firm grasp of the last guardian's prophecy.

## The Manifestation

And then, in a blink of an eye, behold—she appeared! Like a regal figure suddenly uncovered by royal curtains, the planetoid manifested itself in real space, sovereign and serene.

And so, at last, the next Great Cycle was given birth, and with it, the age of high adventure!
