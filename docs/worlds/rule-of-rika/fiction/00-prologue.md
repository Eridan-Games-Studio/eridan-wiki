# Prologue: Before the Rika

> *"The path stands ready for the worthy."*  
> — Ar Kharazon, Last Grand Vizjerei

---

Between the time when the **Gorion Star** went supernova and the **Vikonian Dynasty** drew its last breath, the **Dominion Xaurid**, the last of the ancient guardians, ascended into the **HenceForth**.  

But in the last days of their transferal, as the ancient rite demanded, they left a single, final instruction for the coming cycle — a galactic location and a voice, that of the last **Grand Vizjereen**, **Ar Kharazon** himself. With a tumultuous voice, he declared:  

> "Wait for her arrival and prove your mettle in ages to come. The path stands ready for the worthy."

Immediately, fully aware that the next Galactic Cycle had begun, the **Titans of Power** — the **Liguni Confluence**, the **Akvira Empire**, and the **Dindrae Tetrarchy** — rallied their strength to full power, committed to engaging the upcoming challenge with the full might of their civilizations. And all eyes in the galaxy turned to the same destined location.  

The first to arrive were the **Akvira** and the **Liguni**. Their fleets positioned themselves at a courteous distance, respecting their common might and title. But as the days passed, so did their patience. A galactic week into the foray, their fleets began to slowly and steadily approach the central perimeter. And as the generals moved their ships ever closer, so too did the shadow of war grow ever stronger.  

Sensing the worst outcomes, the **Chancellors**, trained to impact the will and steer emotion, gave their utmost to sway the opponents through diplomatic means. At first, appeals were made — but these soon gave way to bribes and offers of trade. When these failed, threats and extortions followed. Yet in all of these, progress was made, slowly but surely. After days of effort, it seemed that a treaty could be made.  

But then, unexpectedly, the **Dindrae Tetrarchy** obdurately warped their mountain cities directly between the two forces and triumphantly declared the dawn of the **"Imune Era"** and their solemn right to command the area.  

The first to react were the **Akvira**. Aggravated by such insolent behavior, their fleets sprang to full combat status. Destroyers and fighters were enveloped in **Nebu Shielding** as kinetic guns accelerated to full power. The **Liguni**, thinking in all-time, responded in equal measure. Their base stars, enveloped in clouds of black organo-ink, spun toward the zone’s center with deadly intent.  

The **Dindrae**, backing their words with power, raised high their crystal spires, their tops crackling with eldritch lightning. Beneath them, their monstrous forms littered the surface of the mountain polis, each one hastening toward its position — unfazed by cosmic cold or fear — laughing.  

But then, at the point of highest tension and without a word of warning, the **bioflux conduits** of the **Zo Har** burst forth from the subspace strata, their anchor ships solidifying the curvature of space as the migration fleet poured like a tidal wave into the unoccupied sector.  

And when the **Zo Har** came, they came singing. With a multitude of voices, the grand Zo Har chorus sang its **ErsteLied** for the first time in galactic history, overwhelming all stellar communications and, for a moment, pacifying the entirety of fleet hostility.  

The **Akvira**, **Liguni**, and **Dindrae** ships immediately froze in their tracks, not daring to fulfill their hostile intentions. For, as all knew, this mighty act was the fulfillment of the ancient rite of **Holmgang**, and a successful claim to the **Mantle of a Great Race**.  

And so it came to be that, in a still, hushed reverence, not one, two, or three — but **four Great Races** — interlocked their intentions in the firm grasp of the last guardian’s prophecy.  

Then, in the blink of an eye — behold! She appeared! Like a regal figure suddenly revealed by the draw of royal curtains, the planetoid manifested itself in real space, sovereign and serene.  

And so, at last, the next Great Cycle was given birth — and with it, the **Age of High Adventure**.
