## Welcome to the Age of High Adventure

In this galactic cycle, the planetoid **Rika** stands as the solemn arbiter of galactic relations.

She calls forth those whose future only she can see, summoning them to her ever-shifting terrain to settle their disputes through trial in combat and strength of influence. 

She guides those whom she chooses to accomplish her inscrutable goals. These are her chosen, her unlikely heroes — her adventurers.

**The Contenders:**
- [**Akvira Empire**](worlds/rule-of-rika/factions/akvira/akvira.md) — A warrior-mystic avian race of rigid hierarchical conduct and imperialistic manners, governed by a cyclically reborn Empress and gifted with a profound sense of prescience; they manifest psychokinetic Nebu metal through the power of their collective subconscious as they seek to harmonize their civilization with the mystery of the Ultimate Mind.
- [**XIA Distribution**](worlds/rule-of-rika/factions/xia/xia-distribution.md) —  Millions of distinct personality clusters (Shen) inhabiting billions of android bodies, constantly evolving through cycles of downloading into physical embodiment, and ascending into the Nine Heaven for experience synthesis.
- [**Liguni Confluence**](worlds/rule-of-rika/factions/liguni/liguni-confluence.md) —  A symbiotic binary race originating from dark, abyssal oceans, composed of task-oriented "Dhul" and pan-temporal "Agon" who co-join to form a single, multi-modal consciousness; they perceive past, present, and future simultaneously.
