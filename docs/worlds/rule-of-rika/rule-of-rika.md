## Welcome to the Age of High Adventure

In this galactic cycle, the planetoid **Rika** stands as the solemn arbiter of galactic relations.  

She guides both individuals, groups and civilizations.

She calls forth those whose future only she can see, summoning them to her ever-shifting terrain to settle their disputes through trial in combat and strength of influence. 

She guides those whom she chooses to accomplish her inscrutable goals. These are her chosen, her unlikely heroes — her adventurers.
