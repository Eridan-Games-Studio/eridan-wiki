## Field Record: Kanghui Du

Kanghui Du still had work to do.  

True, this planet was well spread out with **Distribution towers**, but for some unknown reason, the **meta signal** was still fluctuating.  

> “This shouldn’t be so,” thought the Permanent, looking inward.

The Dominant currently remained unreachable due to important calculations. The other Shen lay dormant, packed not to vex the Interstitial Space.  

Du expanded his halo antenna slightly, a habit he had developed on his previous mission with the **Memri pirates**, who, for some ancient cultural reason, found the gesture intimidating.  
This time, he didn’t feel so motivated.  

He raised his right, four-digit arm and, for a moment, observed it, visualizing solutions.  
The Instrumental was cheery today, representing a number of solutions in a simulated higher alto:  
> “The meridian antenna, the conflux scanner, the resonance mediator..."

The Permanent agreed on a proposal,  
> “The scanner."  

The Instrumental replied swiftly in a joyful tempo,  
> “The conflux scanner it is!”  

The Interstitial Space moved from within Du as the Instrumental came forward, the right hand changing into the form of a **twin fork conflux scanner**.  

“This will do,” said Du, as the Instrumental’s playfulness permeated his awareness, eager to investigate a solution.  

Some time passed, and Du found the source of the error.  
The **Weave** was glitching in the segmenta sector.  
He marked the error and relayed the subprocess, ready to pack up and leave for the factory, but then, in the distance, Du recognized the silhouette of the great **Matriarch** approaching with haste.  
“Hm,” he said out loud and thought, “She must be running.”  

The Dominant broke away from his calculations, triggered by urgency:  
> “I can overlay," it started.  

“No need,” responded Du, “the Matriarch will need technical advice anyway.”  

The Matriarch came closer now, just in time for Du to wrap up his internal graphs of the tower malfunction. She extended her arms in a sign of warm greeting as her voice boomed beneath her trunk.  

> “Kanghui Du! My favorite distribution!” she bellowed. “How is the connection?"  

“Matriarch!” Du bowed his head in a courtesan gesture. “I am just investigating the weave's stability. We have some slight fluctuations. It will be quickly remedied. How farest thee, Matriarch?”  

“Bah!” she responded, stomping her four hooves into the ground.  
“The merchant guild is getting on my nerves by the day.  
They are eager to connect with the distribution network, but there is little I can offer them.  
Thus I come to you, engineer."  

Her eyes narrowed, and Du could perceive a small trail of hot air venting from her ears — a sign of clear anger.  

> “I am taking over,” overlaid the Dominant, relegating the calculation management to the Permanent and subtracting the Instrumental.  

Du’s body expanded slightly in the shoulders, the halo above his head now gleaming a soft golden hue.  

“Aaah,” the Matriarch growled, entertained by the shift in Du’s Interstitial Consciousness.  
“Am I that threatening to you, Du?”  

“Not threatening your sovereignty,” Du responded in a cool, secure voice.  
“We just wish to take this matter seriously.  
The connection I am currently running on is a high-speed one, and I can report back to my heaven for further assistance if required...Matriarch.”  

"Oh, is that so?” She let loose a big grin, the fur on her neck electrifying.  
“So, the distribution is ready to invest more resources into the completion of this service?  
That’s a new one!”  

She stomped her right hoof into the dirt.  

“Naturally, Matriarch,” Du responded in the same tone, his inspector tool now slowly reforming into the shape of his other four-digit hand.  
“I will just need to complete these last calculations and report to my heaven.  
Once I do so, the distribution will download the other agents into their bodies.  
I will accompany, of course.”  

“Of course,” she said, still holding her grin, but her eyes were round now.  
Du could perceive her neck muscles relaxing.  

“All right, Du, all right."  
She turned her massive torso away, but her head remained fixed on his face.  
“Just better be quick about it."  

"Yes, Matriarch, with Xia haste."  

“With Xia haste!” she roared, half-laughing, and Du could not say if she was mocking him.  
But with that she waved her massive fur-covered arm and galloped away.  

Kanghui Du blinked once and twice, eyes never leaving her figure.  
> “Unpack the other Shen,” the Dominant instructed. “They need to prepare for the report.”

## Stranded

XinZhu despised this endless gray sky.  
Its oppressive hue weighed down on his interstitial consciousness, squeezing him with the force of a hydraulic press, and he utterly disliked the sensation.

Moreover, he felt that he hated the sensation, but the effect of hate had long since been erased from the **Distribution's core banks**, and XinZhu wasn't sure what to feel about that fact.  
*Compassion?* This interpretation was a strange concept to him, so at least his recursive function responded.

---

He did a quick check of his **ontological connections**, but the distribution he was currently stored with was of low bandwidth and he couldn't get much out of it.

> “Gods, I have been left half blind on this abandoned world.”

> “Gods?” The Dominant intervened to recall the internal representations.  

> “The Xia do not believe in gods. Why do I make such connections?”

> “I believe your interstitial coherence is being gnawed away, and there is cross‑reference memory contamination,” replied the **Permanent**.

> “The Source?” demanded the Dominant.

Another layered self broke through and came up with a concept:  
> “The Scrapper.”

“The Scrapper? What was that?” Xin thought.  
“Some kind of package... One I have to bring... but where?”

---

A single raindrop fell on his face and XinZhu realized he was still looking at the sky, unflinchingly, as the clouds loomed ever so closer.  
His steel face frowned.  
*Gods he hated this sky.*  
And it seemed to be pressing on him by the minute.
