## The Garden

The birthplace of the Innervation is their home planet — **The Garden**.  
A unique place in the galaxy, it is the sole source of the parasitic spores called **Bilja**, the evolutionary foundation of the Innervation.

In Garden's planetary time, every two decades, the monumental rose trees will bloom to release their pollen-like spores into the air, covering the skies in a purple-red hue. Any complex biological organism exposed to this pollen through skin contact will be affected. The pollen spore will quickly reproduce and spread throughout the organism, causing rapid development and changes to the host organism's internal structure, down to the cellular level. The bone structure will be strengthened, and adjustments will be made to the muscles and fibers to increase flexibility. Additionally, the organism's neural pathways will be improved.

Visually, the body's skin, feathers, or fur may also undergo changes, but not to the extent of becoming entirely covered in leaves and small flowers. Instead, and particularly for the conscious races, these areas will mainly cover only parts of the body, like a single shoulder, the back of the neck, the upper back, and the lower neck. Most importantly, and after several weeks of transformation, the organism will grow a single whip-like appendage resembling the stem of a rose plant, covered in thorns and petals, and ending with a bloomed rose.

The purpose of this whip organism, the hallmark of the Innervation race, will be twofold.  
First, it will allow the individual to manipulate objects in the environment, as other races do with their trunks, tails, or arms, thus adding another layer of physical action to the individual.  
Secondly, and most importantly, the spines growing on the appendage will be able to secrete various highly specific substances, including psychoactive and poisonous substances, but also to collect, by sucking, liquidized resources through their glands and nerve endings.

## The Neuro‑Psychological Nature of the Innervated

This ability is the hallmark of the Innervation Race, for it is inextricably linked to the neuro‑psychological make-up of the Innervation.  
For, when a sentient organism becomes fully **innervated**, it requires constant external neuropsychological stimulation in order to uphold its psychological wellbeing. And the best stimulation is provided by extreme experiences.

So, the Innervation will live to experience, to be stimulated, to experience new and novel things through other sentient individuals in the galaxy. And in return, the Innervation will provide them with the means to freely enter into and experience such states, in a secure manner.

## The Touch and the Embrace

This ability is made possible by their whips, as they secrete a custom‑tailored substance that is injected through the thorns into the skin of the sentient individual.  
This process is called **"the touch"** if the individual is seeking a lesser experience, and **"the embrace"** if one seeks to experience the potent form.  
For the latter, the whip is wrapped in its entirety around the body, secreting a greater amount of substance into the host's body for a longer period of time.

Importantly, the whips will also be able to deliver some vital medical substances into the host's body, keeping the user in a healthy state throughout the experience and even creating some medically beneficial effects including the improvement to one’s immune system, detoxication, and other longevity related benefits. For these health related reasons, many races seek to be touched by the Innervation even if they dislike the experiential aspect of the touch.

However, the majority will seek Innervation to experience a period of exhilaration or joy, on the border of insanity, or deep tranquil peace and harmony, as well as grief and sadness, all according to their needs and desires.  
Innervation will provide all these experiences, but at the cost of taste.

For every sentient individual who allows themselves to be touched or hugged by their embrace, they will also be able to connect with the experience of the user through their whips.  
Their facial expressions, perspiration, heart rate, breathing, the twitching of their muscles, and then the inner workings of their bodies, the contents of their blood and sweat, and then even deeper, the agitation of their nerves — all these bodily signals and states will be felt through the embrace of the whip, thus innervating the member of their race with vibrant emotions.

## “Geren and Girga”

> ”I don’t know”, she replied. ”It really doesn’t seem right to me that you should go and leave everything you have here just to become infected on that accursed planet, and for what? For an experience thrill?!”

> ”Geren, it's not about experiencing thrills; I told you that already. For my entire life, I always wanted to bring myself to greater heights, and innervation is the next logical step for me.”

> ”So, what? Now you are going to leave this life completely behind, betray your own history, your own species?”

> ”No, Geren, I am not betraying anyone. Innervation will not delete who I am. I…it will… It will add to me.”

> ”It will infect you!”

> He sighed. ”I am sorry you think like that.”

> ”Well, I am not! And I will not be! These people are a poison to the galaxy, Rida. What do they bring? Pleasure seekers, junkies! There is nothing good about them!”

> ”That’s not true, Geren, and you of all people know it. The medical and psychological benefits of the innervation touch have been thoroughly documented through the millennia. They can help people cope, find new meaning in life, and start anew.”

> She quickly turned her gaze away from his.

> ”Look”, he continued, but with a churning stomach. ”I know this has nothing to do with the innervation, but rather with me. You simply don’t want to let go of me, do you?”

> ”Of course, I don’t!” she gasped. ”I am sick of finding new mates, Girga! Of going through the reproductive cycles each time anew! I…I wanted to settle this time, and finally”, she ended in a whisper.

> He hugged her with his big, three‑fingered fur‑covered hand.

> ”I am sorry, Geren, but that is not the life for me; you know that. You knew that from the start.”  
> She tightened her lips, face downward, to hide the coming tears, her self‑confidence dropping, knowing he was right.
