# DINDRAE TETRARKY

## Overview

Dindrae Tetrarky manages the Dindrae society through a governing system comprised of four clans. These four clans represent four dominant emotions that govern the lives of all Dindrae: pride, anger, compassion, and elevation.

## Social Structure: The Bhava System

Although Dindrae possess similar cognitive abilities, they do not share the same emotions if they do not belong to the same clan. Specific Dindrae individuals will always be dominated by one of the four main emotions — pride, anger, compassion, or elevation — and will therefore join the corresponding clan where such emotion is prevalent.

The social structure based on this distinction is called, in Dindrae tongue, **"Bhava."**

## The Clans of the Dindrae

### Bahih — Life Outside

The first two groups, **Krodha** and **Grnha**, belong to what Dindra call "Bahih," or *life outside*, and thus are primarily oriented towards conquering new fields in science, business, trade, art, and the general progress of Dindrae civilization, including diplomacy and inter-species relations.

#### Krodha Clan
The Krodha Dindrae harness their burning rage to crush their enemies and assert their dominance, earning a reputation as fearsome and relentless warriors. They are fierce defenders of justice, swiftly punishing any who dare challenge the rights of their people. Aligned with the element of fire, they mirror its destructive power in battle.

#### Ghrna Clan
The Ghrna Dindrae are drawn to the pursuit of science and business. With an insatiable thirst for success and social recognition, they will constantly strive to prove Dindrae's superiority to all other races. The Ghrna Dindrae hold their race’s foremost scientists, inventors, and business savants.

### Antah — Life Inside

The other two groups, **Karuna** and **Urdhvata**, belong to what Dindrae call "Antah," or *life inside*.  
Dindrae that belong to these groups aim to cure and connect, to bring depth and clarity, understanding, and novel interpretations to what Hanze accomplishes.

#### Karuna Clan
The Karuna Dindrae are a compassionate and empathetic group. Their natural heightened empathy will put them in the position of advisors, therapists, and counselors for their race. Likewise, the Karuna will often accompany the Ghrna in vital interspecies discussions, especially in tense situations at the edge of conflict.

#### Urdhvata Clan
Lastly, the Urdhvata Dindrae are the guiding force behind the Dindrae civilization, providing leadership, inspiration, and vision. Urdhvata are fundamentally guided and inspired by the **Ekata Myth**. For the Urdhvata, all Dindrae will one day unite to become whole.

Importantly, these Dindrae also believe Ekata desires the elevation of other races, and the galaxy as a whole. This vision has gained the Urdhvata widespread acceptance and admiration among other races, particularly the **Akvira**.

## Myth and Philosophy: The Story of Ekata

>In the vast expanse of the universe, in ages foregone and forgotten, a divine being known as **Ekata** was.  
>It resided on a magnificent mountain, naked and in deep meditation, contemplating the wondrous complexity of all things — stars and beasts alike.  
>But as it delved deeper into its existence, a sense of solitude enveloped Ekata.

>Realizing it was unlike any other entity in existence, forever left to be alone in its understanding, Ekata willed its thoughts into motion to divide itself into four distinct bodies, each >of equal standing, thus creating the first four Dindrae.

>However, this act of separation shattered Ekata's internal coherence, and the first Dindrae manifested with different and varying embodiments, each possessing only a fraction of Ekata's >original depth of understanding.  

>And thus, the **Bhava** was born —  a force of anger to combat that which is wrong,  
>pride to protect that which is right, compassion to heal and restore brokenness,  
>and elevation to guide the way forward and back, to Ekata.
