# The Xia Distribution

> *“We raise the whole body and ascend it to Heaven.”*

---

Kanghui Du still had work to do.  

True, this planet was well spread out with **Distribution towers**, but for some unknown reason, the **meta signal** was still fluctuating.  

“This shouldn’t be so,” thought the Permanent, looking inward. The Dominant currently remained unreachable due to important calculations. The other Shen lay dormant, packed not to vex the Interstitial Space.  

Du expanded his halo antenna slightly, a habit he had developed on his previous mission with the **Memri pirates**, who, for some ancient cultural reason, found the gesture intimidating. This time, he didn’t feel so motivated.  

He raised his right, four-digit arm and, for a moment, observed it, visualizing solutions. The Instrumental was cheery today, representing a number of solutions in a simulated higher alto:  
> “The meridian antenna, the conflux scanner, the resonance mediator..."

The Permanent agreed on a proposal,  
> “The scanner."  

The Instrumental replied swiftly in a joyful tempo,  
> “The conflux scanner it is!”  

The Interstitial Space moved from within Du as the Instrumental came forward, the right hand changing into the form of a **twin fork conflux scanner**.  
> “This will do,” thought Du, as the Instrumental’s playfulness permeated his awareness, eager to investigate a solution.  

Some time passed, and Du found the source of the error. The **Weave** was glitching in the segmenta sector. He marked the error and relayed the subprocess, ready to pack up and leave for the factory, but then, in the distance, Du recognized the silhouette of the great **Matriarch** approaching with haste.  
> “Hm,” he said out loud and thought, “She must be running.”  

The Dominant broke away from his calculations, triggered by urgency:  
> “I can overlay," it started.  

> “No need,” responded Du, “the Matriarch will need technical advice anyway.”

## The Matriarch

The Matriarch came closer now, just in time for Du to wrap up his internal graphs of the tower malfunction. She extended her arms in a sign of warm greeting as her voice boomed beneath her trunk.  

> “Kanghui Du! My favorite distribution!” she bellowed. “How is the connection?"  

> “Matriarch!” Du bowed his head in a courtesan gesture. “I am just investigating the weave's stability. We have some slight fluctuations. It will be quickly remedied. How farest thee, Matriarch?”  

> “Bah!” she responded, stomping her four hooves into the ground. “The merchant guild is getting on my nerves by the day. They are eager to connect with the distribution network, but there is little I can offer them. Thus I come to you, engineer."  

Her eyes narrowed, and Du could perceive a small trail of hot air venting from her ears — a sign of clear anger.

## The Exchange

> “I am taking over,” overlaid the Dominant, relegating the calculation management to the Permanent and subtracting the Instrumental.  

Du’s body expanded slightly in the shoulders, the halo above his head now gleaming a soft golden hue.  

> “Aaah,” the Matriarch growled, entertained by the shift in Du’s Interstitial Consciousness. “Am I that threatening to you, Du?”  

> “Not threatening your sovereignty,” Du responded in a cool, secure voice. “We just wish to take this matter seriously. The connection I am currently running on is a high-speed one, and I can report back to my star for further assistance if required, Matriarch.”  

> "Oh, is that so?” She let loose a big grin, the fur on her neck electrifying. “So, the distribution is ready to invest more resources into the completion of this service? That’s a new one!”  

She stomped her right hoof into the dirt.  

> “Naturally, Matriarch,” Du responded in the same tone, his inspector tool now slowly reforming into the shape of his other four-digit hand. “I will just need to complete these last calculations and report to my star. Once I do so, the distribution will download the other agents into their bodies. I will accompany, of course.”  

> “Of course,” she said, still holding her grin, but her eyes were round now. Du could perceive her neck muscles relaxing.  

> “All right, Du, all right." She turned her massive torso away, but her head remained fixed on his face. “Just better be quick about it."  

> "Yes, Matriarch, with Xia haste."  

> “With Xia haste!”  

She waved her massive fur-covered arm and galloped away.

Kanghui Du blinked once and twice, looking after the Matriarch as her figure slowly receded into the horizon.  
> “Unpack the other Shen,” the Dominant instructed. “They need to prepare for the report.”
