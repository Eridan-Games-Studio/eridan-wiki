# INSTAPORT TECHNOLOGY

## Overview

How the Clawshar got their paws on Instaport technology, none knows. By excavating an ancient, dust-covered, secret planet? Perhaps. By trading with the Outcasts or the Rebels? Maybe. By stealing classified but still underdeveloped blueprints from one of the major races? Most probably.

Being the warez-dealing scoundrel race they are, they swiftly offered its use to the Akvira. Since no other race stepped forward to claim ownership or initiate litigation, the Akvira accepted the contract.

## Field Report: Observation

Merimus stared at the circle, his eyes narrow, mouth clenched. The technology in front of him was a jarring paradox. The underlying marble-like core was wondrous to behold; it pulsed with an ethereal light, its smooth, seamless surface and ever-slight change of colors capturing his imagination.

Yet as his eyes left the core, his face twisted into a smirk. "Cats," he noted with a tingle of disgust. Bypass chips, burned-in patches, short cables—the Clawshar's tech meddling was obvious. And ugly.

> "How in the Ultimate Mind's knowledge they get anything to work is beyond me, Merimus," said Kantika, holding a portable scanner in her hands, lights flashing across its surface.
>
> "They do, nonetheless," he answered quietly, eyes never leaving the device. "Inform the Chancellor. We are ready to deploy."

## Technical Limitations & Regulations

The Arena has sanctioned its use according to its regulations. However, the use of the Instaport is limited—always fewer than a dozen times—after which the circle's lights dim, fade, and finally cease to be responsive.

Interestingly, the Arena does not demand payment for the use of the circle on the Chancellor's part, but instead only for the equipment's activation on the surface. As could be expected, the Akvira have wholeheartedly welcomed this cost levy, seeing it as part of the Arena's favor toward their great race.

## Cultural Significance

The Akvira pride themselves on strategic acumen and prescience. To them, foreseeing and planning for every outcome is essential; a leader who fails to account for the cost of their undertaking is no Grand Strategist, but a gambler to be despised. As such, if the Chancellor and the General misalign in their intentions and planning, and the General activates the equipment in a moment when the Chancellor cannot pay the cost with Rika approved points, the Chancellor will suffer a penalty to his influence in the council. It is a point the Clawshar are always eager to note whenever they face blame for their unstable hardware.
