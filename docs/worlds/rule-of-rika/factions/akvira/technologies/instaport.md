# INSTAPORT TECHNOLOGY

## Overview

How the Clawshar got their paws on the Instaport cores none knows. By excavating an ancient, dust-covered, secret planet? Perhaps. By trading with the Outcasts or the Rebels? Maybe. By stealing classified but still underdeveloped blueprints from one of the major races? Most probably. 

Being the warez-dealing scoundrel race they are, they swiftly offered its use to the Akvira. Since no other race stepped forward to claim ownership or initiate litigation, the Akvira accepted the contract.

## Lab Report

Merimus stared at the circle with narrow eyes and a clenched mouth. The technology in front of him was a jarring paradox. The underlying marble-like core was wondrous to behold; it pulsed with an ethereal light, its smooth, seamless surface and ever-slight change of colors capturing both his vision and imagination.

Yet as his eyes left the core, his beak clapped twice, shortly, narrowly. 

Bypass chips, burned-in patches, short cables. The Clawshar's tech hacks were obvious. And ugly.

"Cats," he exhaled with audible contempt. 

> "How in the Ultimate Mind's knowledge they get anything to work is beyond me, Merimus," said Kantika, standing beside him. A portable scanner in her hands flased lights across its surface in periodic tempo.
>
> "They do, nonetheless," he answered quietly, eyes never leaving the device. 

> "Still", she responded soberly, "The energy outputs on this piece fluctuate wildly. Their hacks may be efficient but they are, as always, quite unstable. This transportation circle will not last more than a dozen uses." 

"We only need a couple." He finally looked up, his gaze determined. "Inform the Chancellor. We deploy now."

## Rika Regulations

Rika has sanctioned the use of Instaport circles to the Akvira according to its regulations. However, due to some unknown reason, the use of the teleporting circle is limited—always fewer than a dozen times—after which the circle's lights dim, fade, and finally cease to be responsive.

Interestingly, the Rika does not demand payment for the use of the circle on the Chancellor's part, but instead only for the equipment's activation on the surface. As could be expected, the Akvira have wholeheartedly welcomed this cost levy, seeing it as part of the Rika's favor toward their great race.

## The Cost of Influence

The Akvira pride themselves on strategic acumen and prescience. To them, foreseeing and planning for every outcome is essential; a leader who fails to account for the cost of their undertaking is no Grand Strategist, but a gambler to be despised. As such, if the Chancellor and the General misalign in their intentions and planning, and the General activates the equipment in a moment when the Chancellor cannot pay the cost with Rika approved points, the Chancellor will suffer a penalty to his influence in the council. It is a point the Clawshar are always eager to note whenever they face blame for their unstable hardware.
