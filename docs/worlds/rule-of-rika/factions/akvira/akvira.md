## EMPRESS AKVIRA

### The Sovereign of the Akvira Empire

The sovereign ruler of the Akvira empire, **Empress Akvira**, sits enthroned in her gilded nest, above the clouds, high atop the **Whaset pyramid**, the pyramid of her people.

Her body, muscular and tense, exudes a commanding presence steadily pulsating in the rhythm of her three giant hearts, as her bright golden eyes pierce through the lower clouds to reach the minds of her people in the capitol’s valley.

The Empress does not sleep nor slumber, and she never speaks in public, for her mind alone constantly stands in the presence of the **“Ultimate Mind”**, the source of all life and vigor in the universe.

And so, contemplating the eternal cause, she reigns in complete silence, her thoughts proclaimed by her four **Viziers**, the *Voices of the Empress*, who never leave her side and with whom she retains a mysterious and unbreakable connection.

---

### The Cycle of Renewal

The Empress, despite her transcendent status, however, is not immortal.  
For every three hundred cycles, she leaves her body to her people as her mind goes forth to rejoin the source of all life.

And so, when the appointed time is close at hand, the Empress lays a single golden egg, imbued with her essence and memories, and from this egg, her successor, the rising Empress, arrives.

For a brief period, the Empress is two, and yet still one.  
The fading Empress will caress the rising Empress under her wings, as she grows in wisdom and stature, to take her rightful place and position.

---

### The Transmission and Ascension

When the appointed time arrives, all of **Akvira**, throughout the Empire, will stand their work, and await the **Transmission**.

Here, at the highest peak of the **Whaset pyramid**, on the **Grand Royal Terrace**, in the presence of all the dignitaries, military and civilian, the rising Empress will recite the sacred **Imperial Creed**.

She will plunge her talons into the central cavity of the old Empress's body to remove her royal treasury.  
And as her three hearts succumb to give their last beats, and the young Empress devours the royal treasury in one fell gulp, the Empress will utter her first and final public words with one voice, in two bodies:

> “And so, I live, again.”

Thus, the Empress stands reborn, and the host of **Morane**, the Empress's elite female guards, strongest bearers of the prescience gift, will surround the Empress with their bodies and lift her onto the royal seat signaling her ascension.

Below in the valley, and across the planet, and upon all of their worlds, the entire **Akvira Empire** will erupt in joyful celebration knowing their Empress is once again with them in the fullness of her vigor and power.

## CULTURE

The central point of Akvira culture is the **pan-Imperia adventures**.

These spectacles are the grandiose reenactment of ancient religious rites from the sacred *Book of the Morning Sun*, with each challenge mirroring the warrior trials awaiting them in the afterlife.

Crafted by talented and trained **Shapers**, who compete annually to create the most dynamic, intriguing, and challenging experiences, the adventures strive to include tests of bravery, intelligence, and physical strength — the aspects of existence Akvira finds to be most worthy of development and safekeeping.

Occurring in specially constructed spaces, blending physical, augmented, and digital realities, the contests are broadcast on a galactic sensory network, allowing the multitude of Akvira citizens to experience the games from manifold sensory perspectives.

### The Rite of Inheritance

Importantly, the victors of the competitions are not only celebrated as role models in the wider Imperia but are also recognized as worthy of receiving the honor of **“inheritance.”**

Here, both female and male victors will be given the honor to enter the royal chambers and discreetly meet the Empress. What occurs behind the closed doors of the inner sanctum none ever speaks of, and no victor withholds the memory of thereafter. But all Akvira know that here transpires a most sacred rite.

The Empress will take the lifeblood of the heroes and incorporate it within her royal treasury, to mix, adjoint, and recombine their best traits with those of all Akvira already residing within her. Thus, when she lays her eggs, as the Empress does so continuously, she is constantly giving back to her race whole nests of the most capable, illustrious, and genial progeny — making her people stronger, more resilient, and fresh with each passing generation.

---

## GOVERNANCE

The Akvira have two biological sexes, male and female, on which their entire culture stands. Based on these, they enter into a **monogamous partnership** that lasts for a lifetime.

Such a decision is easily made and upheld for the Akvira as they lack the biological capacity to experience romantic affection. Consequently, Akvira marriages are based on the decision of optimal cooperation synergy between two partners and the social benefit such a partnership is capable to produce.

Predominantly, this entails that for each Akviran pair, the highest social ideal is that of the **provincial governors**, since the Empire is divided into provinces, and each province is governed by three pairs of married eagles for a set number of cycles.

---

### The Right of Challenge

Importantly, however, the right of partnership can be challenged under strictly defined conditions, and only in a specific period. Thus, both the original female and male Akvira in a marriage partnership can be interchanged for another Akvira, if that challenger bests the challenged party in a set of ceremonial duels.

As is described in the marriage covenant recited by both Akvira:

> “With this oath, I now take you as mine, and with each day passed, while my strength lasts, I will make myself stronger and more fierce.  
> And if a challenger appears, better than me, and proves it so, I will give away my right, without spite, for you are worthy of it.”
