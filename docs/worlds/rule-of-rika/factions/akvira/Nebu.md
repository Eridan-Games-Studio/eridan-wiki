# Nebu Metal

---

## Overview

The cornerstone of the Akvira industry and military is the enigmatic metal called **Nebu**.  
This rare material, endowed with a myriad of remarkable properties, can only be found on those planets that the winged people have colonized, making Nebu an exceedingly precious and sought-after resource throughout the galaxy.

## Purpose and Use

As a fuel source, Nebu's energy reserves are harnessed to both power the Akvira's vast armada of warships and spacefaring vessels, and the multitude of appliances that grace the everyday lives of Akvira citizens.

In physical combat, Nebu will be formed into paper-thin bodily protection that ensures maximum flexibility of limbs and wings while providing almost unparalleled protection.  
This will enable a greater range of motion and speed of movement, making Akvira soldiers highly effective in aerial strikes and the use of various combat utilities and weapons without hindrance.

In addition, the psychoactive properties of the metal will add some form of extrasensory perception that becomes more potent with prolonged wear.  
Thus it will not be rare to see Akvira veterans wearing the same armor pieces for the duration of their lives, proudly showing their battle marks.

All of this is most poignantly represented in **Rika battles**, where Akviran veterans will enter the battles covered in personally tailored **Nabu fiber-skin**, providing the warriors with full body protection that simultaneously augments their reflexes and overall agility through its action-prediction ability.

## Nebu Uniqueness

The mystery of Nebu's formation is a byzantine matter, which the Akvira call **"Sekhem Ren"**, a term roughly translated as *“Power forms our identity.”*

This alchemical process occurs deep within the planet's crust and defies even the most advanced scientific inquiries, but what can be surmised is that the Akvira, through some unknown collective force, change the properties of ordinary heavy metals in the planet's crust, to realize the Nebu.

Importantly, Akviras are incapable of consciously controlling this process, and thus no technological replication of the metal is possible. 
As a result, Nebu represents a unique resource in the entire Galaxy intrinsically tied to Akvira planets.  

For this reason, Akviras view the Nebu metal as a sacred symbol of their connection to the **Ultimate Mind**, a tangible expression and vivid proof of the royal bond between themselves and the forces that govern the cosmos.

## Cultural Significance

Akviras will aim to show adornments made of Nebu metal whenever possible, and their warriors, especially those in the **Rika**, will wear embellished Nebu armor pieces to show their worth and royalty.

Likewise, wearing Nebu metal by non-Akvira is deemed either a symbol of great and rare honor, if the piece of metal was given freely by an Akvira,  
or a grave cultural insult if taken by force, stolen, or acquired without Akvira consent.

Thus, each Akvira has to ask the non-Akvira from whom did they inherit the Nebu piece.  
And it is in the best interest of the non-Akvira to answer positively, as the quickest path to provoke an Akvira into a fit of swift, calculated attack is to openly and unjustifiably wear pieces of Nebu armor.

## In the heat of battle

*As Gekhem's eyes fell upon the Liguni Dhul, he knew he had to act swiftly.*

*The mind-slave did not inherit the displacement ability from his previous coupling and it now stood open to aerial assault. With a quick command, he signaled his team to move in from the flanks, while he launched himself at the enemy from the front.*

*With the grace of a hunting bird, he swooped in towards the Liguni, his Nebu armor tightly pressing against his dense muscles, slightly adjusting his trajectory mid-air for maximum impact.  
As he closed in on the enemy, he drew his weapon to this chest, a Kar-Gun Assault Rifle, endowed with armor-piercing ammunition, and aimed at his opponent.*  
*Suddenly the Dhul turned his face towards him, tentacles swirling in defense position, but it was all too late. Gekhem's strike was swift and precise, and the entire set of gleaming blue-colored kinetics slammed into its torso with a deadly intent sending him stumbling backward.*  
*But Gekhem was not done yet. He dived down towards his foe with incredible speed, his fiber suit tightening around his chiseled muscles adjusting his flight vectors for optimal impact.*

*An instant before the impact the bionic talons released with a loud clank, and with a sudden adjustment, Gekhem grabbed the still-struggling Dhul firmly in his empowered claws and lifted him into the air with ease.*  

*The thing fought to break free, but it was of no use. Gekhem spat and hurled his adversary away with incredible force, crashing it to the ground.*
