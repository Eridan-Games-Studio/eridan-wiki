## The Sovereign of the Akvira Empire

The sovereign ruler of the Akvira empire, **Empress Akvira**, sits enthroned in her gilded nest, above the clouds, high atop the **Whaset pyramid**, the pyramid of her people.

Her body, muscular and tense, exudes a commanding presence steadily pulsating in the rhythm of her three giant hearts, as her bright golden eyes pierce through the lower clouds to reach the minds of her people in the capitol’s valley.

The Empress does not sleep nor slumber, and she never speaks in public, for her mind alone constantly stands in the presence of the **“Ultimate Mind”**, the source of all life and vigor in the universe.

And so, contemplating the eternal cause, she reigns in complete silence, her thoughts proclaimed by her four **Viziers**, the *Voices of the Empress*, who never leave her side and with whom she retains a mysterious and unbreakable connection.

## The Cycle of Renewal

The Empress, despite her transcendent status, however, is not immortal.  
For every three hundred cycles, she leaves her body to her people as her mind goes forth to rejoin the source of all life.

And so, when the appointed time is close at hand, the Empress lays a single golden egg, imbued with her essence and memories, and from this egg, her successor, the rising Empress, arrives.

For a brief period, the Empress is two, and yet still one.  
The fading Empress will caress the rising Empress under her wings, as she grows in wisdom and stature, to take her rightful place and position.

## The Transmission and Ascension

When the appointed time arrives, all of **Akvira**, throughout the Empire, will stand their work, and await the **Transmission**.

Here, at the highest peak of the **Whaset pyramid**, on the **Grand Royal Terrace**, in the presence of all the dignitaries, military and civilian, the rising Empress will recite the sacred **Imperial Creed**.

She will plunge her talons into the central cavity of the old Empress's body to remove her royal treasury.  
And as her three hearts succumb to give their last beats, and the young Empress devours the royal treasury in one fell gulp, the Empress will utter her first and final public words with one voice, in two bodies:

> “And so, I live, again.”

Thus, the Empress stands reborn, and the host of **Morane**, the Empress's elite female guards, strongest bearers of the prescience gift, will surround the Empress with their bodies and lift her onto the royal seat signaling her ascension.

Below in the valley, and across the planet, and upon all of their worlds, the entire **Akvira Empire** will erupt in joyful celebration knowing their Empress is once again with them in the fulness of her vigor and power.
