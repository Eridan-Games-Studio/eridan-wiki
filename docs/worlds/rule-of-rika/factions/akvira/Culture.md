# Culture and Governance

## Culture

The central point of **Akvira culture** is the **pan‑Imperia adventures**.

These spectacles are the grandiose reenactments of ancient religious rites from the **Book of the Morning Sun**, with each challenge mirroring the warrior trials awaiting them in the afterlife.

Crafted by talented and trained **Shapers**, who compete annually to create the most dynamic, intriguing, and challenging experiences, the adventures strive to include tests of **bravery, intelligence, and physical strength** — the aspects of existence the Akvira find most worthy of development and safekeeping.

Occurring in specially constructed spaces that blend **physical, augmented, and digital realities**, the contests are broadcast through a **galactic sensory network**, allowing countless citizens to experience the games from manifold sensory perspectives.

### The Rite of Inheritance

Importantly, the victors of the competitions are not only celebrated as role models in the wider Imperia but are also recognized as worthy of receiving the honor of **“inheritance.”**

Here, both female and male victors are granted the sacred privilege of entering the **royal chambers** and meeting the **Empress** herself. What transpires within the inner sanctum is never spoken of — and no victor retains the memory thereafter.

But all Akvira know that a most sacred rite takes place.

The **Empress** takes the lifeblood of the heroes and incorporates it into her **royal treasury**, to mix, adjoint, and recombine their finest traits with those of all Akvira already residing within her.  
Thus, when she lays her eggs — as she does so continuously — she gives back to her race entire **nests of strong, resilient, and ingenious progeny**, ensuring that each generation surpasses the last.

## Governance

The Akvira have **two biological sexes**, male and female, upon which their entire social structure stands.  
Based on these, they enter into **monogamous partnerships** that last for a lifetime.

Such unions are easily formed and faithfully upheld, for the Akvira lack the biological capacity for *romantic affection*.  
Their marriages are not born of love, but of **synergy** — designed around **optimal cooperation and social benefit**.

Each partnership ideally contributes to the harmony and efficiency of the Empire.

### Provincial Rule

In Akvira society, the highest social ideal is that of the **provincial governors**.  
The Empire is divided into numerous provinces, each ruled by **three pairs of married eagles** for a designated number of cycles — six beings governing as one unified body of will, logic, and vision.

### The Challenge of Union

However, the **right of partnership** is not absolute.

Once during a specific ceremonial period, either partner — male or female — can be **challenged** by another Akvira seeking to take their place.  
The duel that follows is fought according to ancient honor codes in a display of physical might, mental clarity, and spiritual focus.

Victory entitles the challenger to assume the bond and position of governance, while the defeated steps aside without resentment, for it is believed that **strength and worth must rule — never sentiment**.

### The Marriage Covenant

Recited at every Akviran union, this vow binds mates in strength and purpose:

> *“With this oath, I now take you as mine, and with each day passed, while my*
> *strength lasts, I will make myself stronger and more fierce. And if a challenger*
> *appears, better than me, and proves it so, I will give away my right, without spite,*
> *for you are worthy of it.”*
