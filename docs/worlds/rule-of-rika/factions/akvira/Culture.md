# AKVIRA CULTURE AND GOVERNANCE

## Culture

The central point of Akvira culture is the **pan-Imperia adventures**.

These spectacles are the grandiose reenactment of ancient religious rites from the sacred *Book of the Morning Sun*, with each challenge mirroring the warrior trials awaiting them in the afterlife.

Crafted by talented and trained **Shapers**, who compete annually to create the most dynamic, intriguing, and challenging experiences, the adventures strive to include tests of bravery, intelligence, and physical strength — the aspects of existence Akvira finds to be most worthy of development and safekeeping.

Occurring in specially constructed spaces, blending physical, augmented, and digital realities, the contests are broadcast on a galactic sensory network, allowing the multitude of Akvira citizens to experience the games from manifold sensory perspectives.

### The Rite of Inheritance

Importantly, the victors of the competitions are not only celebrated as role models in the wider Imperia but are also recognized as worthy of receiving the honor of **“inheritance.”**

Here, both female and male victors will be given the honor to enter the royal chambers and discreetly meet the Empress. What occurs behind the closed doors of the inner sanctum none ever speaks of, and no victor withholds the memory of thereafter. But all Akvira know that here transpires a most sacred rite.

The Empress will take the lifeblood of the heroes and incorporate it within her royal treasury, to mix, adjoint, and recombine their best traits with those of all Akvira already residing within her. Thus, when she lays her eggs, as the Empress does so continuously, she is constantly giving back to her race whole nests of the most capable, illustrious, and genial progeny — making her people stronger, more resilient, and fresh with each passing generation.

## Governance

The Akvira have two biological sexes, male and female, on which their entire culture stands. Based on these, they enter into a **monogamous partnership** that lasts for a lifetime.

Such a decision is easily made and upheld for the Akvira as they lack the biological capacity to experience romantic affection. Consequently, Akvira marriages are based on the decision of optimal cooperation synergy between two partners and the social benefit such a partnership is capable to produce.

Predominantly, this entails that for each Akviran pair, the highest social ideal is that of the **provincial governors**, since the Empire is divided into provinces, and each province is governed by three pairs of married eagles for a set number of cycles.

### The Right of Challenge

Importantly, however, the right of partnership can be challenged under strictly defined conditions, and only in a specific period. Thus, both the original female and male Akvira in a marriage partnership can be interchanged for another Akvira, if that challenger bests the challenged party in a set of ceremonial duels.

As is described in the marriage covenant recited by both Akvira:

> “With this oath, I now take you as mine, and with each day passed, while my strength lasts, I will make myself stronger and more fierce.  
> And if a challenger appears, better than me, and proves it so, I will give away my right, without spite, for you are worthy of it.”
