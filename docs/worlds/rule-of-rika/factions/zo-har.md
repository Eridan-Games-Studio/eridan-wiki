## The Last of the Grand Races

The last of the grand races to enter the galactic stage is the **Zo Har**, a single organism of magnificent individual diversity. 
Its **collective consciousness** and distributed organism is forged by a multitude of individual, interchangeable, and adaptive members.

The individual lifespan of a Zo Har is short — only **five planetary cycles** — but its development is rapid, allowing the collective Zo Har organism to overcome environmental changes with astonishing speed.  

Importantly, the individual members of the Zo Har are organized into **specialized groups**, whose functions may be compared to bodily organs of other species.

External consesus divides the Zo Har into three great groups:  
- **Warriors**  
- **Builders**  
- **Thinkers**

Within these groups, individual members may exhibit unique physical traits based on function — glittering armor, oversized horns, elongated appendages, or iridescent markings.  

Intriguingly, certain body parts (especially horns) can be **detached** and later **reattached** by others — even across individuals, living or deceased — demonstrating an extraordinary fluidity of biological transfer.

## Terraforming — The Unique Power of the Zo Har

> *“Once the Zo Har descends on a barren world, they will explore the area and anchor their hatcheries into the ground to initiate a steady production of Zo Har larvae.”*  
> — Civix Augmentus, *The Zo Har: A Mystery Unfolds* (Kyria Principality)

After the number of individual Zo Har rises to a critical threshold, a **collective change** overtakes the colony. Members begin sprouting **spear-like appendages**, which, upon full maturity, are driven into the planet’s crust with tremendous force.

At depth, the shell of each spear dissolves, releasing a **worm-like organism** that tunnels through the ground, **breaking down inorganic matter** and releasing nutrients into the subterranean environment.  

After cycles of feeding and growth, these creatures enter reproduction, forming **new copies within themselves**, consuming the original host in the process. The newly born entities continue the terraforming sequence in an exponential rhythm, transforming barren worlds into living ecosystems.

Through this recursive generational process, the Zo Har are able to **reshape entire planets**, aligning ecology with purpose — a mystery both biological and metaphysical.

## Interspecies Relations

To this day, it remains precisely unknown how the Zo Har effectively communicates across the vastness of space.  
Most scholars accept the hypothesis that their consciousness operates through a form of **quantum entanglement**
For this reason, scholars are perplexed why the Zo Har also manifests **light, sound, and scent** in localized areas. 
Scholar, but not poets and musicians, who view the Zo Har as one of the Galaxy's most profound and mysterious artists. 
> *"It will not be uncommon for a large group of outsiders to attend Zo Har gatherings, simply to enjoy and record these musical and light spectacles as one would a favourite concert. The Zo Har do not usually mind observation, but it remains best to enjoy the scene from a safe distance…"*

## First Contact and Galactic Acceptance

The **Liguni Confluence** were the first race to decode a working translator of the Zo Har language, becoming their earliest political advocates. The Liguni urged the **Galactic Council** to invite the Zo Har into its cooperative framework, arguing that their terraforming gift was too significant to leave unsupervised.

The **Akvira Empire** soon became strong supporters of Zo Har inclusion, guided by their prescience and reverence for destiny.  
At the **Three Hills of Anauroch**, emissaries of the Empress herself observed a great Zo Har chorus performing what they called the **Mission Song**.

For the Akvira, this revelation was transcendent — an experience of *understanding without cognition*, as though emotion had taken the form of philosophy. Upon returning to the capital, the Empress issued a **golden letter of support**, sealed with her talon — a gesture unseen in a hundred galactic cycles.

Following this, the **Dindrae Tetrarky**, **Santariana Innervation**, and even cautious members of the **Kyria Principality** aligned behind the proposal, leading to the Zo Har’s historic ascension to Council membership.

## The Mission and the Tower Trees

The Zo Har claim no empire, no influence, and no territorial desire.  
Their motive, referred to simply as **“The Mission,”** eludes even the most advanced translators. It appears to be both biological imperative and spiritual pursuit.

Whenever the Zo Har terraform a world, they erect a monumental structure known as a **Tower Tree**.  
This organic colossus grows from the surface over time — trunk‑like, immense, and crowned with a gigantic **fruit-pod**.

When the fruit begins to open, the Zo Har prepare for departure.

Gathering in perfect circles at the mountain’s base, they perform their **Last Song** — a resonance so powerful that it charges the Tower Tree into collapse. The structure releases its stored energies in a **cataclysmic pulse**, altering the atmospheric balance and leaving the planet fertile and reborn.

Within hours, the tree withers to ash, and the Zo Har depart the world — their purpose fulfilled, their presence transmuted into life itself.
