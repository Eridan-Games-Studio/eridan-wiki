## The Zo Har Species Overview

The last of the grand races to enter the galactic stage is the **Zo Har**, a gestalt organism of magnificent diversity, its collective consciousness and distributed body forged by the multitude of individual, interchangeable, and adapting individual members.

The individual life span of the Zo Har is short, its life force constrained by five planetary cycles, but its development is rapid, enabling the collective Zo Har organism to overcome any environmental changes with rapid adaption.

Importantly, the individual members of the Zo Har are organized into specialized groups whose functions could be compared to bodily organs and are, most broadly, delineated into three distinctive groups: **warriors**, **builders**, and **thinkers**.

Inside of these groups, and specific to their designated function some Zo Har will exhibit individual bodily characteristics that set them apart from others of their kind. These can include having specifically colored or glittering armor, extended or oversized horns, bigger appendages, and the like. Interestingly enough, some of these individual body parts, especially the horns, can be detached, cast away, by specific Zo Har just to be picked up and reattached, annexed, by another Zo Har individual – even if the original bearer is deceased.

However, and most importantly, both the cognitive and physical abilities of the Zo Har are location-based – they depend on the mutual vicinity of other Zo Har in the same physical area. As such, the more Zo Har are present in the same location, the greater their capacities for action will be – a fact most visible in the act of **terraforming**.

## Terraforming: the unique power of Zo Har

> *“Once the Zo Har descends on a barren world, they will explore the area and anchor their hatcheries into the ground to initiate a steady production of Zo Har larvae.*

> *After the number of individual Zo Har rises to a required level, a collective change will occur in the individual members, as they begin sprouting a spear-like outgrowth from their behinds or backs. These will be, upon reaching full maturity, injected into the planet’s ground with the tremendous force of a high-speed projectile.*

> *Upon reaching a designated depth, the external protective layer of this biological container will dissolve and a worm-like organism will emerge from it. Propelled by some innate awareness, these creatures will burrow through the ground, breaking down inorganic matter and releasing valuable nutrients into the subterranean environment.*

> *After a period of continuous burrowing and feeding and upon reaching their full size the beings will find a warm subterranean pocket to initiate their reproductive cycle. Here, enveloped by a protective gel-like substance they will develop smaller versions of themselves, as identical genetic copies, deep inside their bodies. These will rapidly develop at the expense of the host, as the entirety of the host's body will serve as a food source for the quickly developing progeny. After a short period of a dozen planetary cycles, the new beings will move out from the now-lifeless original entity to continue the cycle of terraforming with greater haste and efficiency.”*

## Zo Har: Interspecies Relations

To this present day, it remains unknown how precisely the Zo Har communicate across the entirety of the wide galactic space but the best available theories argue that this is made possible through some form of informational quantum entanglement.

Still, in localized, planet-based, communications the Zo Har relies on a set of various signals, including light, sound, and smell. Thus, it will not be a rare sight to behold a group of Zo Har members rapidly changing the color of their armor, emitting strong scents, flashing light from the tip of their appendages, or producing short interval sounds by their chitinous wings, which will be interwoven to produce complex melodies, all while operating in a single area.

> *"It will not be uncommon for a large group of outsiders, from various races and under some of the best galactic travel agencies, to attend Zo Har gatherings, simply to enjoy and record these musical and light spectacles as one would a favourite concert. The Zo Har do not usually mind this observation, but the agencies have learned that it remains best to enjoy the scene from a great distance and not within the perimeter of Zo Har activity, the discovery of which has proved gruesome in some initial travels".*

## The Zo Har and the Galactic Council

The **Liguni** were the first race to produce and patent a successful translator for the Zo Har language, and the first major force to advocate for their inclusion in the galactic council. This move the Liguni justified on the Zo Har’s terraforming ability, arguing that such a massive ability should be deployed from within the council’s cooperative framework, to ensure wider galactic stability and optimal development of uninhabitable galactic zones.

The other relevant races eagerly accepted such a proposal, and an economic framework was quickly set up where interested races could propose their offered price and target planets for the Zo Har to terraform.

> *A little-known fact outside of diplomatic circles is that although the Liguni were the first to accept the Zo Har, it was the **Akvira** who were the strongest supporters of their inclusion. For the Akvira, uniquely amongst races, possesses the gift of foresight, the ability to peer into the unfathomable depths of hidden realities.*

> *And so, as in that fateful meeting at the **Three Hills of Anauroch**, where a number of Morane emissaries sent by the Empress of Akvira herself met with a large group of Zo Har, the emissaries witnessed in silence as the Zo Har sang of their "mission".*

> *For the participants, the experience of the Zo Har chant was something like a faint immersion, a quickly fleeting experience between a mood and a clear thought. Like a light breeze or mild sunshine on a warm morning, the understanding of the mission was left ephemeral with the listeners. But not for the **Morane** who clutched their black wings in reverence and held their golden eyes closed as their minds gazed into the vast magnificence of the Zo Har Mission.*

> *When the song ended, the Zo Har turned and left in silence, one by one, and so did the Akvira. But soon after their return to the capital planet, the Akvira Praetorians brought to the Council a golden letter of support for the Zo Har, stamped with the Empress's talon, a sight not seen in a hundred galactic cycles.*

> *Observing the sudden shift in galactic currents, the **Dindrae** wasted no time in throwing the full weight of their support behind the Zo Har's admission. The **Santariama Innervation** was thrilled to join the support and meet the Zo Har firsthand, eager to experience a novelty. The **Principality of Kyria** and the **Xia Distribution** cautiously abstained, but not without reason, citing some ancient principles and more time for calculation, as was expected.*

## Diplomatic Framework

If the Zo Har express the intention to terraform a planet or planetoid in the custody of a recognized race, the framework will aim to arrange proper compensation for both parties. Otherwise, a delay or outright refusal can be decided upon, after conferring all the proper evidence.

In some cases, however, the Zo Har will still instill to terraform the planet, by the reason of their “Mission”, despite an outright refusal or delay. In such cases, the engaged parties would resolve their case at **Rika Battlegrounds**.

Interestingly enough, in each case where the Zo Har have lost their right to colonization and terraforming, the Rika has always given the right of reclamation to the Zo Har, which enables the Zo Har to reclaim the rights to the celestial body after the passing of five generations.

In all of this however, and per consensus, it seems that the Zo Har bear no enmities towards other races as in all of their galactic relations the Zo Har stood utterly disinterested in engaging in any form of territorial disputes or conflicts over resources.

Instead, as the galaxy’s brightest minds are continuously set to fully understand, the Zo Har behavior, from cycle to cycle, corroborates that their overall civilization is guided by their adherence to a concept which the translators inadequately describe as **"mission" or "purpose"** — an idea whose full comprehension evades the broader galactic society despite fervent scholarly efforts.

That which remains obvious however is that the Zo Har, led by their enigmatic mission, choose specific planets in the galaxy to first terraform and then build their **enigmatic tower trees**.

## BUY IT NOW!!!

> *For the love of the Twelve Virgins of Mandros, listen to me Arunda!
> If you leave this system up for grabs, the Dindrae will burst the market with a price that no other broker will be able to recover from!
> And I have direct confirmation that Yizru, the chief trader of Solania, is already transacting another strategic planetoid to offer as compensation for the bugs!
> So now we have to worry about both of them! And don't ask me how in the darkest depths of his ocean did the symbiont get the information. Who can grasp Liguni's minds?!
> I swear, sometimes I would rather be put on an Innervation Pain Tree to rattle my bones for the entire day than do business with these specialized jacks.
> So! If they are on it, then this system is worth dozens of cycles of effort!
> You must buy it now!
> And I don't care if you have to borrow from the Akvira or the Xia again!
> Offer them the tons of Belurian Gas you have stored in your private cache.
> Yes, the ones you think no one else knows about! MOVE!*

## The Zo Har Tower Tree

After landing on a planet, and after the initial cycles of terraforming, the Zo Har will gather in a huge assembly at the top of the highest mountain to inject the ground with a multitude of their spear-like appendages.

They will then continue their terraforming process as something like an organic tree-like structure gradually emerges from the earth, with a closed fruit-like end at its apex.

As the Zo Har terraform the planet, their tree will grow to a remarkable height, and as it does, its fruit will begin to open. When this happens, the Zo Har will know that their time of departure is near and will gather at the base of this structure in perfect circles and almost their full numbers.

And as the last individual member lands in his place, the Zo Har will begin their **Last Song**, the tune of which few souls have heard in person, as the Zo Har fervently and forcefully rejects any form of observance of this phenomenon.

As the song builds to its crescendo, the organic tree will be brimming with power, as if feeding on the collective presence of the Zo Har, its fruit fully opening as the energy of the tree coalesces at its center.

And then, at the climax of the event, the fruit will emit a powerful discharge and **explode**, sending waves of gravitational and electromagnetic forces into the atmosphere and beyond.

Once this phenomenon is complete, the tower will dry out within hours and the Zo Har will begin their departure from the planet.
