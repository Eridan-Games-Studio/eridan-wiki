## THE DINDRAE TETRARKY

### Overview

Dindrae Tetrarky manages the Dindrae society through a governing system comprised of four clans. These four clans represent four dominant emotions that govern the lives of all Dindrae: pride, anger, compassion, and elevation.

---

### Social Structure: The Bhava System

Although Dindrae possess similar cognitive abilities, they do not share the same emotions if they do not belong to the same clan. Specific Dindrae individuals will always be dominated by one of the four main emotions — pride, anger, compassion, or elevation — and will therefore join the corresponding clan where such emotion is prevalent.

The social structure based on this distinction is called, in Dindrae tongue, **"Bhava."**

### The Clans of the Dindrae

#### Bahih — Life Outside

The first two groups, **Krodha** and **Grnha**, belong to what Dindra call "Bahih," or *life outside*, and thus are primarily oriented towards conquering new fields in science, business, trade, art, and the general progress of Dindrae civilization, including diplomacy and inter-species relations.

##### Krodha Clan
The Krodha Dindrae harness their burning rage to crush their enemies and assert their dominance, earning a reputation as fearsome and relentless warriors. They are fierce defenders of justice, swiftly punishing any who dare challenge the rights of their people. Aligned with the element of fire, they mirror its destructive power in battle.

##### Ghrna Clan
The Ghrna Dindrae are drawn to the pursuit of science and business. With an insatiable thirst for success and social recognition, they will constantly strive to prove Dindrae's superiority to all other races. The Ghrna Dindrae hold their race’s foremost scientists, inventors, and business savants.

---

#### Antah — Life Inside

The other two groups, **Karuna** and **Urdhvata**, belong to what Dindrae call "Antah," or *life inside*.  
Dindrae that belong to these groups aim to cure and connect, to bring depth and clarity, understanding, and novel interpretations to what Hanze accomplishes.

##### Karuna Clan
The Karuna Dindrae are a compassionate and empathetic group. Their natural heightened empathy will put them in the position of advisors, therapists, and counselors for their race. Likewise, the Karuna will often accompany the Ghrna in vital interspecies discussions, especially in tense situations at the edge of conflict.

##### Urdhvata Clan
Lastly, the Urdhvata Dindrae are the guiding force behind the Dindrae civilization, providing leadership, inspiration, and vision. Urdhvata are fundamentally guided and inspired by the **Ekata Myth**. For the Urdhvata, all Dindrae will one day unite to become whole.

Importantly, these Dindrae also believe Ekata desires the elevation of other races, and the galaxy as a whole. This vision has gained the Urdhvata widespread acceptance and admiration among other races, particularly the **Akvira**.

### The Story of Ekata

> In the vast expanse of the universe, in ages foregone and forgotten, a divine being known as **Ekata** was.  
> It resided on a magnificent mountain, naked and in deep meditation, contemplating the wondrous complexity of all things — stars and beasts alike.  
> But as it delved deeper into its existence, a sense of solitude enveloped Ekata.

> Realizing it was unlike any other entity in existence, forever left to be alone in its understanding, Ekata willed its thoughts into motion to divide itself into four distinct bodies, each of equal standing, thus creating the first four Dindrae.

> However, this act of separation shattered Ekata's internal coherence, and the first Dindrae manifested with different and varying embodiments, each possessing only a fraction of Ekata's original depth of understanding.  

> And thus, the **Bhava** was born —  
> a force of anger to combat that which is wrong,  
> pride to protect that which is right,  
> compassion to heal and restore brokenness,  
> and elevation to guide the way forward and back, to Ekata.

## THE DINDRAE ECONOMY

### Overview

"Doing business with one Dindrae is doing business with all of Dindrae."

— *Grashrok the thief*

---

### The Concept of Rasa

The Dindrae share a unique emotional telepathy, which they call **"Rasa"** – coarsely understood to mean *“The echo of the mind of Ekata.”*

Rasa allows each member of the Dindrae species to directly grasp the true intentions of other Dindrae in their vicinity as specific flavors. This shared semi-telepathic connection results in a heightened sense of empathy and understanding between Dindrae individuals and prohibits all forms of conniving and obfuscation between them.

Consequently, fair and open trade and candid commercial practices are the hallmarks of Dindraean innovation and economy, as Dindrae dispense their ideas and assets with complete trust and transparency, secure in the knowledge that all their kindred act in good faith and to mutual advantage.

Rasa also serves as a means of social cohesion and conflict resolution among the Dindrae which is unparalleled amongst other sentient races. Disagreements and misunderstandings are quickly resolved as emotional perspectives are shared from the inside out in real-time, fostering a greater sense of community and belonging among the Dindrae where no fear of judgment or rejection resides.

### The Economic Foundation: Dhana

"Well, it’s not difficult to dominate the economy when money is literally growing out of you."

— *Darek the proud, vestibular emissary of the Xaun Federation*

**Dhana**, the crystalline precious stones, start growing underneath Dindrae scales as they enter their maturation period and continue to do so until a Dindrae lives. The variability of these precious stones is vast, often uniquely tied to specific Dindrae, even though the four Dindrae groups will usually develop similar precious stones within their ranks.

The stones are produced continuously throughout a Dindrae's life, but they need to be harvested once they protrude for others to develop. Thus, from their maturity onward each Dindrae will have a replenishing stock of precious stones to use as an economic resource for barter, trade, and gifting.

Importantly, for each Dindrae a small but important variation in the type of precious stones its body produces will always be present, making the **Dhana** a highly varied and very valuable economic resource. Moreover, the older a Dindrae gets, the bigger and more complex the internal structure and coherence of the stones will be — a fact adding much value to its economic worth.

Not all of these gems will be harvested, however, since each Dindrae will allow some of these gems to grow towards great size and will proudly wear them as other races would wear jewelry or ornaments. Most often, and with specific Dindrae groups, **Dhana** will grow in some specific pattern.

### Scholarly Commentary: “Observing the Dindrae”

> "I am fully aware that my hypothesis will not be popular and will probably be marketed as Luddite talk, but I have decided to propose it anyway.
>
> For you see, the mark of a true scholar is to attack the popular bias and challenge the preconceived notions. Accordingly, I wish to challenge the common belief that the Dhana are nothing more than an oh-so-happy economic gain made possible by some quirk or long-forgotten design in Dindrae biology.
>
> Thus, I propose that the true purpose of the Dhana lies in their intrinsic ability to serve as facilitators of Dindrae's empathic powers, specifically their ability to manifest aura. This hypothesis, unfortunately, I am currently unable to prove with scientific methods other than those of observation and logical conjecture.
>
> Based on this fundamentally reasonable method, I observe how Dindrae only grows extensively in their emotion-sensing and manifesting abilities after they reach the age of maturity, which is also the time when these stones begin to become visible on their bodies. And it is a known fact that the Dindrae only send the oldest, and therefore largest and most powerful, members of their caste into the Rika, all of whom invariably manifest a large size and number of these crystalline growths. And as the majority of galactic citizens know, these Dindrae manifest an extraordinarily powerful range of their emotional auras.
>
> Of course, the implications of my conclusion, as the astute reader may have already gathered, are vast and possibly dangerous. For if the Dindrae are able to affect the emotions of those around them to tremendous heights and depths, and manifest this ability through their crystal stones, are not all those who carry, hold, and use these stones throughout the galaxy also affected by the Dindrae's emotional manipulation? Have we all been tricked into using the Dhana as an economic currency without understanding its true purpose? Have we all carelessly fallen into an elaborate trap?"

— *From the treatise “Observing the Dindrae” by Mikron Aules, 25th librarian of Solana.*
