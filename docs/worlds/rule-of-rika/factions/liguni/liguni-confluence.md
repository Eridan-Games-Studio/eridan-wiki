## Introduction

> *"Their minds, like their birthplace — a vast, deep, and dark ocean."*  
> — *Seghmet Gor, 1st Legion, Tertiary Commander, Akvira Empire*

The **Liguni race** is comprised of two evolutionarily distinct subspecies:  
the **Dhul**, the less‑sentient but highly intelligent,  
and the **Agon**, the highly‑sentient but less intelligent Liguni.

The Dhul are highly focused and specialized, with each individual being capable of performing specific tasks with efficiency and accuracy. They are capable of quickly adapting to situational change and can synchronize their behavior to optimize their goal‑driven performance in an instant.

However, their knowledge and awareness of the world is always limited by the confines of their current goals. As such, if the Dhul are to operate in the world as individual beings, they require continuous melding with the Agon, in whose embrace the Liguni individual can generate updates for the Dhul's ongoing tasks.

Similarly, it also stands with the Agon, whose pan‑temporal sentience simultaneously perceives past, present, and future timelines, but which, without their symbiotic coupling with the Dhul, stands dispersed, lacking the focused clarity to analyze linear causation and thus achieve a quick and precise analysis of the present and the planning of future tasks.

## Symbiosis

Importantly, Agon and Dhul rarely interact with other members of the galaxy without being co‑joined as a single Liguni, a fact that is also manifested on the battleground. Thus, in both social and hostile environments, the Liguni will stand endowed with the combined strengths and none lack their abilities — manifesting, amongst all other races in the galaxy, the most attentive and mindful awareness of the present moment and all of its possibilities.

For, when coupled, the Liguni individual will not only be laser‑focused on the best course of action to achieve a specific goal, it will also be simultaneously aware of all the overlapping aspects influencing the origin, process, and outcome of that goal.

This multi‑modal awareness makes Liguni minds self‑aware in ways that are incomprehensible to other galactic races, a fact also starkly reflected in the Liguni language, conveyed through overlapping sounds representing different, often conflicting, concepts.

For this reason, other species have had many problems in understanding the Liguni's true intentions, which have remained incomprehensible for a great number of cycles and whose cryptic status has procured many political and economic hostilities with other species.

## Historical Record

> **Inborn System, Galactic Enc. Entry, 12a5gZ — as depicted by Rolan Aunderian, The Society of Wyr:**
>
> By the stars!  
> These battles could have spiraled into a full‑fledged interspecies war, one that may have even aroused the wrath of the Guardians themselves.  
> But lo and behold, the Terran Autarky, without a single word of warning, and in true fashion of their unbridled, barbaric might, folded space directly into the biggest and most intensive space battle, and instantly triggered a reality‑ossification of the entire area.
>
> Their secretive Esoterika‑class Devastators armed to the teeth, and in full power, boosted the Autark's message through the sector, who, ever so ready for a bloodbath, immediately threatened to scour the entire region and all of its fighting force to ash if the belligerents did not immediately lay down their arms and dispatch their negotiators to the Autark flagship.
>
> Unwilling to provoke a reaction, both the Liguni and the Akvira heeded the demands, and quickly embarked to meet in the diplomat's center aboard the flagship.
>
> Surprisingly, for the first time in the annals of galactic history, to end the conflict the Autarks provided the assistance of their Melders — an occurrence which substantiated the rumors that the reason the Autarky moved in to stop the conflict was to prevent an imminent Guardian cleansing.
>
> Here, sitting on the fur‑clad seats of the Autarks, the Akviran and Liguni chancellors were melded, the Liguni's thought process was laid bare and the Akvira immediately understood the cause of the dispute.  
> Thus, a treaty was forged and an official request to accept the Liguni ambassadors into the galactic council was sent, marking a great landmark in galactic affairs.

## Technology

**Liguni technology** builds on, relies upon, and complements the race’s symbiotic abilities.  
One could even say that their entire technological endeavor is one of **extension and augmentation**, but not substitution, as every technological tool the Liguni use participates in their manifold symbiotic prowess — predominantly their exorbitant cognitive capacities.

One such prime example is the **Liguni Nest‑Ships**, especially their **BaseStars**. Here, in the protected sub‑processing compartments, the Dhul will connect with the ship’s action niches on a neural level, reducing the load from the ship's central processing matrix by acting as specialized information computers.

Similarly, the Dhul will often merge with one or more signal carriers inside a Liguni fighter swarm, allowing the swarm to more easily coordinate its combat maneuvering and decision speed.

The Agon, on the other hand, will come to the ship's central space to interconnect with the source matrix, thus creating an **emergent awareness** that projects the possibility of manifold causalities from the viewpoint of the ship’s strategic actions — enabling a **fleet‑wide neural mesh network** between the Nest Ships.

Additionally, coupled Liguni will often cybernetically interconnect with their smaller to mid‑ranged ships — in smaller or greater numbers depending on the size and complexity of the craft — blurring the distinction between the **inanimate and the animate** in the Liguni technological landscape.

### Combat Doctrine

In personal combat, as occurs on the **Rika battleground**, the Liguni will not wear any armor protection, as their bodies and minds will provide adequate defense through their reinforced exoskeletons and full manifestation of **eldritch might**.

Here, as is accustomed to Liguni, the Dhul entering the Rika battle will be **bioengineered** to counter specific opposing units, while the Agon will manifest **powers of ethereal manipulation**, always targeting the structural and psychological advantages of enemy forces.

## Negotiation Scene

The symbiont executed a circular waving gesture, its suction cups closing and opening in an intricate pattern too complex to follow even with my ocular apparatus. Yet, the translator registered a palpable sense of contentment, satisfaction, and possibly even a hint of self‑importance stemming from my recognition of their bargaining prowess.

> *"Affirmative,"* the machine projected a rough encapsulation of its cogitations. *"Our endeavors are united, as are yours. Your decline is our ascent, and our collapse is your rise."*

The swirling of its tentacles continued for a moment and then froze and fell limpid, the Liguni still levitating a couple of centimeters above the ground.

Swiftly, I communicated with my Subpersona via a covert subcarrier:  
*"By Arcturus, I said to steal the data, not to slay it!"*

She shot back:  
*"You wish, Derek. I barely initiated the cog‑intrusion. The alien is very much alive. I have no idea what has occurred."*

I narrowed my gaze at the Liguni chancellor. A moment passed, and another — my mind racing with the influence of reading steam coursing through my veins.  
*"Curse the governor for putting me up to this. We are no match for this beast!"*

And then, its limbs activated with a sudden swirl, forming into a perfect circle, the air becoming frigidly tense — the consequence of rising power emanating from its body.  
My translator struggled to decipher its words:

> *"We were here/there/prior,"* it declared.  
> *"We observe how this conflict concludes/commences/unfolds."*

A loud mental snap reverberated within my tertiary cortex, and Liana let loose a string of compressed profanities:  
*"Cursed be their fortifications and their alien minds! You will not make me endure this again, Derek Corvax!"*

And with that, out of protest, she plunged herself into hibernation as all of my computational readings shot hot red through the visual represented.  
*"Murder…" I sighed and shut down the entirety of my augmentations."*

I was left alone now, blinking with eyes open, heart beating, and stomach roiling in the presence of my oldest nemesis.  
The silence between us lasted for a couple of seconds, but then the air loosened some of its tight grip on my throat, signaling the easing of tension. Across its tentacles, a dozen suction cups opened and closed in harmonious cadence. Though no words were uttered, I swear, I knew its thoughts.

**Iaguur was grinning.**

I shrugged and surrendered with a courteous gesture, as demanded of a defeated party:  
*"Let it be so then. The Enclave will fully accede to Liguni conditions."*
