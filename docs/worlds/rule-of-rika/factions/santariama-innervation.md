## The Garden

The birthplace of the **Innervation** is their home planet — **The Garden**.  
A unique world in the galaxy, it is the sole source of the parasitic spores called **Bilja**, the evolutionary foundation of the Innervation.

In the planet’s local time, every two decades, the **monumental rose trees** bloom, releasing pollen-like spores into the air and covering the skies in a purple-red hue.  
Any complex biological organism exposed to this pollen through skin contact will be affected. The pollen spores quickly reproduce and spread throughout the organism, causing rapid development and structural changes down to the cellular level. Bone density increases, and muscular fibers adapt for greater flexibility. Additionally, the organism’s neural pathways become enhanced.

Visually, the skin, feathers, or fur of the affected being may show new organic growths — not full leaf coverage, but elegant patterns across **localized areas** such as the shoulders, neck, or upper back.  

Most distinctively, after several weeks of transformation, the organism grows a **whip-like appendage**, resembling the stem of a rose plant. It is covered in thorns and petals, culminating in a small, blooming flower.

## The Whip of Innervation

The purpose of this **whip organ**, the hallmark of the Innervation species, is twofold:

1.  **Manipulation** — The whip acts as an additional limb, allowing the user to interact with objects and environment much like an arm or tail, enhancing physical utility.  
2.  **Connection** — The thorns of the whip secrete various compounds — psychoactive, medicinal, or venomous — and can absorb liquids and nutrients through capillary-like glands and nerve endings.

This organ is key to the **neuropsychological makeup** of the Innervation. When a sentient being becomes fully *innervated*, it requires constant neuropsychological stimulation to maintain wellbeing.  
The greatest stimulation comes through **intense emotional and sensory experiences**.

Thus, the Innervation live to experience — to feel — to be in constant dialogue with the sensations of others across the galaxy. In return, they provide others the means to share in these sensations safely.

## The Touch and the Embrace

This profound connection is made possible through the secretion of a tailored biochemical substance delivered via the thorns of the whip.  
The process is called:

- **The Touch** — a mild, localized form of the experience.  
- **The Embrace** — the potent version, where the whip fully coils around the recipient, saturating the body in a prolonged neurochemical exchange.

During *The Embrace*, both parties share a mutual flow of emotion, memory, and neural data.  
The experience is described as ecstatic but overwhelming — verging on divine communion.

In addition to sensory pleasure, the whips can deliver **medical substances** to the host’s system, resulting in proven physiological improvements: enhanced immunity, detoxification, and increased longevity.  

For these reasons, many seek Innervation therapies for health benefits — even those who otherwise fear their culture or its sensual practices.

## The Exchange of Experience

Most races, however, pursue Innervation for emotional transcendence — states of **exhilaration**, **bliss**, or **tranquil harmony**, even **sorrow and catharsis** — each tailored to desire.  
Through the whip-born link, the Innervation not only provide sensation but also **absorb** it.

Every heartbeat, tremor, and flicker of emotion in the connected individual — facial expression, perspiration, heart rate, neural agitation — is **reciprocally experienced** by the Innervation.  
They feed on sensations as emotions manifest physically.  

To touch another being, for them, is to participate in that being’s **total existence**.

## Interlude: A Farewell

> *"I don’t know,"* she replied. *"It really doesn’t seem right to me that you should go and leave everything you have here just to become infected on that accursed planet — and for what? For a thrill?"*  
>   
> *"Geren, it’s not about thrills. For my entire life, I’ve wanted to bring myself to greater heights, and innervation is the next logical step for me."*  
>   
> *"So what? Now you’ll leave this life behind? Betray your own species?"*  
>   
> *"No, Geren. I’m not betraying anyone. Innervation won’t erase who I am… it will add to me."*  
>   
> *"It will infect you!"*  
>   
> He sighed. *"I’m sorry you think like that."*  
>   
> *"Well, I am not! And I will not be! These people are a poison to the galaxy, Rida. What do they bring? Pleasure seekers, junkies! There’s nothing good about them!"*  
>   
> *"That’s not true, Geren, and you of all people know it. The medical and psychological benefits of the innervation touch have been thoroughly documented throughout the millennia. They help people cope, find meaning, start anew."*  
>   
> She turned her gaze away, her throat tightening.  
>   
> *"Look,"* he continued, voice heavy with hesitation. *"I know this isn’t about Innervation — it’s about me. You just don’t want to let go."*  
>   
> *"Of course I don’t!"* she gasped. *"I’m sick of finding new mates, Girga! Of going through the reproductive cycles again and again. I wanted to settle this time — finally."*  
>   
> He embraced her with his large, furred hand.  
>   
> *"I’m sorry, Geren, but that’s not my life — you knew that from the start."*  
>   
> She lowered her head, tightening her lips to hide the coming tears, her confidence collapsing under the weight of truth.
