## The Empress

High above the clouds, enthroned in her **gilded nest atop the Whaset Pyramid**, sits the sovereign ruler of the Akvira Empire — **Empress Akvira**, the divine center of her people’s faith and power.

Her body, **muscular and tense**, radiates a commanding presence, each movement pulsing in rhythm with her **three great hearts**. Beneath her radiant form, **golden eyes** pierce through the mists of the capital’s valley, reaching into the minds of her people. Through that gaze, every Akviran feels both seen and judged — a living connection to their goddess-empress.

The Empress neither sleeps nor slumbers.  
She never speaks in public, for her mind remains eternally intertwined with the **“Ultimate Mind”** — the source of all life and cosmic vigor. Her voice echoes instead through her **four Viziers**, known as *The Voices of the Empress*, bound to her in psychic symphony. They speak as one, their tongues carrying divine decree, while the Empress herself lingers in meditation upon the Eternal Cause.

And though transcendent, she is not immortal.

## The Cycle of Rebirth

Every **three hundred galactic cycles**, the Empress’s time wanes.  
When the moment of **Transcension** arrives, her essence must return to the Source. Yet, before her flame fades, the Empress performs the **Ritual of Continuance** — ensuring the unbroken lineage of divine rule.

At the appointed hour, beneath the trembling sky, the Empress lays a **single golden egg**, imbued with her own memories, power, and soul. From this relic is born her successor — **the Rising Empress**.

For a sacred period, the two coexist — **one soul, two vessels**. The elder Empress gently nurtures the younger beneath imperial wings, passing to her the wisdom of countless ages.

## The Transmission

When the Transmission Rite begins, every Akviran, from the spire-courts to the stormed cloud-harvest fields, halts their labor and turns their minds to Whaset. All gather in silence beneath the **Grand Royal Terrace**, where the ceremony unfolds before the watchful eyes of dignitaries, soldiers, and citizens from every world of the Empire.

Here, on the summit of the **Whaset Pyramid**, the rising Empress recites the **Sacred Imperial Creed** — words older than the first sun:

> *“Her will endures through flesh renewed. Her sight pierces ages. Her truth returns unbroken.”*

Then, as the sacred rhythm builds, she **plunges her talons** into the heart cavity of the Elder — retrieving the **Royal Treasury**, the crystallized vessel of memory and consciousness.  
With reverence, she devours it whole.

At that instant, the Elder’s hearts give their final triple beat.

Together, in perfect unison, **the two Empresses** speak the only words ever uttered by their lips in the presence of their people:

> *“And so, I live again.”*

## The Ascension

The moment of renewal births a storm of sound and light. Across the empire, from the silver deserts of Ar’Kesh to the storm-vented gas moons of Zeul, jubilation erupts.  

The **Morane Guard** — the Empress’s elite sentinels, all female, gifted with the rare art of *prescience* — encircle the new sovereign. With solemn grace, they raise her above the expiring body of her predecessor and enthrone her anew amid cascading banners of molten gold and crimson.

Below, the capital’s valley trembles with electric chants.

The Empire rejoices.  
The Empress is reborn.  
**Akvira lives again.**
