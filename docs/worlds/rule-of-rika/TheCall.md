# Rule of Rika

Now, Rika stands upright as the linchpin of galactic stability. Arbiter, legislator, and judge of the new galactic order, on her ground galactic denizens clash their dreams and aspirations to prove their worth and value.

## The Ways of Rika

At designated intervals, when the **Aranik Shield** pulses and fades, Rika extends her embrace. It is in this time that the Pilgrims flock.

Many will come, but not all will be allowed to descend onto her ground. Formal emissaries will most often be granted access to the altars of dispute — but not always, and for reasons none may tell.

It is not unknown that even a formal diplomat from the mighty **Akvira** or **Liguni** may not be granted entry, while a small shuttle of a single household from some minor, unbeknownst race will.

For the Pilgrims, many crystalline altars will be made manifest on Rika's ground, and the number of Pilgrims will make no change in accommodation. For in some unbeknownst manner, whoever approaches Rika's orbit during the time of the **Pilgrimage** will never find the area cluttered. Once they land at the coordinates delivered to their navigation systems, they find themselves alone before her altars — none else in sight or sound.

> "It is my firm belief that, as with all other things in her might, Rika consciously folds reality around her perimeter to enable thousands and millions of pocket realities for those who seek her aid and her judgment. Some will find hundreds and thousands of pilgrims like themselves, others a hundred and a dozen. And only the rarest few — a couple, or none at all."  
> — *Gohtra, the Seventh*

Here, amidst the sprouting silver-white crystal flowers, they will proclaim their cause one by one, offering soil from their homeworlds as testimony and shedding blood or flesh upon the sprouted altars to prove their intentions.

Whatever data container they have, they will also place, and in response, the crystals will hum and shine, and the data crystals will receive the instructions for resolution — as will the memory of all those who attend.

And upon returning to their ships, they will find that same verdict etched into their vessels' core memories.

This is the way of the **Pilgrimage**.

### The Call

But there is another path — **The Call**.

A broadcast will be sent from Rika, across all communications, and also directly into the carriers of the target groups — delivering a simple message: *the Date, Time, Races, and the Goal for the Call.*

The content of the Call may vary. Rika may summon two groups to settle their disputes through **"The Rite"** on her hallowed grounds. This may often include actors whose conflicts threaten to destabilize the galaxy. A trade war, a growing military conflict, or a fervent cultural battle often holds the highest potential to trigger **The Call**.

However, and more mysteriously, the Call will sometimes summon agents engaged in slight offenses — such as a break in diplomatic ties or a seemingly insignificant skirmish in space.

### The Journey

But Rika may also send the Call to accomplish some **inscrutable goal** known only to her. Denizens of the galaxy call this **"The Journey."**

Here, she does not summon champions or diplomats, but **ordinary folk** — alone or in small, unlikely bands — caught up in their daily lives far from the grand cosmic stage.

Brought together by her will, they embark as **strangers** into futures they cannot see, guided only by her cryptic charge.

These journeys often begin with a simple task: *retrieve an artifact, mediate a minor dispute, deliver a message*. But they evolve into something **far greater** — trials that intertwine with the galaxy's deepest mysteries.

Their paths may end humbly, without accomplishing any grand outcome one might expect from such a calling.

But whatever their end, their shared trials **profoundly transform those who walk them** — not through glory or conquest, but through **understanding, connection, and the healing of old wounds**.

This is **The Journey of Rika** — the path of the chosen few whose experiences **reshape not worlds, but souls**, rekindling the meaning of **empathy, belonging, and unity** in a fractured cosmos.

## The Consequence of Refusal

And if the Call is not answered?

To disobey the Call is to disobey the Rika, and to disobey the Rika is a grave fate indeed. Minor signs are given first.

A rogue comet might abruptly change its trajectory to threaten vital civilizational points. Unexpected and potent fluctuations in the local star might jeopardize years of planetary investments.

In ignorance of these, major signs are given.

Planetary destabilizations, major earthquakes or volcanic activity will manifest. The star's solar output might be reduced or vastly improved, threatening life on the home planet. The planet's moons might change their distance to break away from the planet or enter into a collision course.

To ignore these calls forth the final judgment.

### The Fall of the Nordom Polarity

It is said that the main reason why the **Anhuru Aristocracy**, one of the usurpers, has vied to destroy the current galactic order lies in the Final Judgment bestowed on her sibling race, **The Nordom Polarity**.

Few such long-lasting and fruitful alliances have been made in recent galactic history as those between the Anhuru and the Nordom, so, at least, historians argue. But the Nordom fell into Rika's unfavored grasp, soon after they declared to be on the verge of discovery of a potent meta-sentient digital form they named **the Scrapper**.

Details of the invention remain vague, shrouded in Nordom's technical secrecy, but soon after this proclamation, minor signs began to occur in Nordom's home system. For unknown motives, the Nordom did not stop their research but instead hastened it. And thus, soon, the major portents occurred. In spite of these, ignorantly or zealously, they continued ever fervently.

For a period, nothing occurred, but then unexpectedly and suddenly the Nordom's star started building up deadly reactions. Nordom initiated a planet-wide exodus, but for many it was too late as their sun burst forth to scour the entire planet with deadly radiation.

Now, remnants of their once-proud civilization traverse through the galaxy, spurned as renegades and outcasts.
