# Worlds

Explore the immersive universes that form the foundation of our gamesâ€”each with unique settings, rich lore, and compelling stories.

## The Rule of Rika

### [The Rule of Rika Universe](rule-of-rika/rule-of-rika.md)
A mythic-ethnographic space opera where the sentient planetoid Rika serves as the cosmic arbiter of galactic relations. Experience transformation as you step into radically different alien mindsets where biology, perception, and even the laws of physics operate differently across species.

## Atomic Horizon

### [Atomic Horizon Universe](atomic-horizon/atomic-horizon.md)
A retrofuturist setting where humanity survives in a corporate-dominated Solar System at the end of the 21st century, after Earth fell to the Engramized Singularity. Space is not an adventure but a workplace, where fusion reactors power expansion, analog technology prevents digital hijacking, and wars are fought over fuel, territory, and survival in the hard vacuum.

## H.A.V.E.N

### [H.A.V.E.N Universe](haven/home.md)
A supernatural-noir setting steeped in crime, occult mystery, and urban paranoia where Haven City itself seems alive, bending events toward chaos. Navigate webs of power, corruption, and forbidden knowledge as every deal has a price, every truth is poisoned, and unseen forces twist fate in this endless night.
