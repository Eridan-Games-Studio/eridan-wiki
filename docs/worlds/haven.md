# H.A.V.E.N

A **supernatural-noir setting** steeped in crime, occult mystery, and urban paranoia.

Here, every deal has a price and every truth is poisoned, drawing players into webs of power, corruption, and forbidden knowledge, as *unseen forces twist fate* in this endless night.

## Overview

Haven City is a place where crime, corruption, and the paranormal overlap. The city itself seems alive, bending events toward chaos while factions, cults, and desperate people fight for control.

As a player, you'll investigate mysteries, confront the supernatural, and navigate shifting alliances. Every choice carries weight: your reputation, resources, and dark secrets shape not only your fate but how the city responds to you.

## Core Concepts

### Crime and Syndicates
Every block is carved up by gangs, enforcers, and shadow brokers.

In Haven, crime isn't just survival—it's **business**, and *everyone owes someone*.

### The Investigators
Whether detectives, rumormongers, or drifters with too many questions, investigators pry open the city's locked doors.

Truth is their trade—though it often *costs more than coin*.

### Cults and Fanatics
Behind closed doors, Haven's cults whisper prayers to entities that **may or may not exist**.

Their devotion is real, their power undeniable, and their motives *never benevolent*.

### Survival and Grit
Haven grinds down the weak, and even the strong need **grit to endure**.

Every choice is a gamble: *live another day, or burn out trying*.

### Investigations and the Paranormal
Every case begins with a mystery and ends with something **no one wants to believe**.

In Haven, the paranormal isn't theory—it's the *evidence you wish you could ignore*.

## The Occult Undercurrent

Haven's streets hum with whispers of the **unnatural**—strange symbols, forgotten rites, and rumors that twist into reality.

The occult isn't hidden; it waits in plain sight for those *reckless enough to notice*.
