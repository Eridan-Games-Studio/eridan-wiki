# Welcome to Haven

The rain never stops in Haven. The streetlights hum like dying stars, the air tastes of copper and old secrets, and the shadows have their own opinions about you.

H.A.V.E.N. is a tabletop roleplaying game of supernatural noir — where detectives, mystics, criminals, and haunted souls chase answers through a city that bends reality to its will.

The city itself is alive. It listens. It remembers.

You can't win against Haven — you can only learn how to live in its rhythm.

## Playing H.A.V.E.N.

As a player, you'll take on a [[Callings|Calling]] — an archetype like Private Investigator, Rumormonger, or Haunted One.

Together with your group, you'll solve cases, confront the paranormal, and try to stay one step ahead of a city that's always watching.

As the Game Master (GM), you'll breathe life into Haven — narrating mysteries, dangers, and opportunities while balancing the invisible heartbeat of the city through the Chaos Pool.

## How to Play

When you attempt something uncertain, dangerous, or dramatic, you'll roll dice to see how it turns out.

Everything else is storytelling and collaboration — players describe what they do, and the GM describes what happens as a result.

Play is divided into Missions and Downtime:

- **Missions** are cases, heists, or investigations filled with tension and risk.
- **Downtime** is the quiet between storms — time to rest, recover, or prepare.

There are no turns outside of combat; time flows cinematically.

If the table agrees that what you're doing matters, roll for it.
