# The City of Haven

Haven isn't a metropolis. It isn't a sprawl of high towers or a coastal jewel.

It's an inland city built on ambition, forgotten gold veins, and too many bad deals.

The people here work, hustle, and hide trying to live in a place that feels like it's always watching.

## Overview

When the mines ran dry decades ago, the city should've died with them. But Neon Corporation came with glowing signs and promises of progress. Now the streets pulse with electric light and the low buzz of cheap technology. coffee-shop computers, clunky cellphones, automated radios. Progress came, sure but so did something else.

Haven isn't a haunted city. It's a city that learned to live with being haunted.

## The Merge of Tech and the Occult

In Haven, the old curses never died, they just adapted. The barn spirits moved into garages. Hexes started riding through phone lines instead of whispers. A ghost that once rattled chains now hijacks radios to play its favorite song.

Technology didn't banish the supernatural; it gave it new tools:

A demon doesn't need a ritual circle anymore — just a password.

A spirit doesn't need a séance — it needs a signal.

Computers, radios, and neon lights don't fight the paranormal. They conduct it.

Half the time, no one notices the static on the line, the flickering bulb, the corrupted file that whispers if you listen too long. The rest of the time, the consequences make the morning paper, if Haven Daily decides to print it.

## The Paranormal in Plain Sight

The supernatural in Haven isn't hidden behind veils or portals. It's in the small things.

Most spirits don't roar — they sigh.

Most demons wear suits or hide in rugged clothes under the bridge.

Most curses are shrugged off as bad luck.

For those who can see beyond the mundane, Haven is crowded. Not everything from the other side is evil — some ghosts just want a drink, or a song, or someone to remember their name. But the balance between the living and the dead is fragile, and the more people tamper with it — through rumor, greed, or faith — the thinner that line becomes.

## Life in Haven

Most people in Haven don't talk about the strange things they see — they talk around them. The office worker explains away the whisper in the elevator as "the vents." The barkeep blames a flickering sign on bad wiring. The city runs on denial as much as on caffeine and electricity.

People scrape by in small ways. Every block has its own ecosystem — the corner grocer who trades gossip for discounts, the mechanic who fixes cars and keeps quiet about blood in the trunk, the old woman who still burns sage in her windowsill. Rent's high, jobs are scarce, and nobody trusts the official story. But the locals have learned one rule that keeps them alive: don't look too closely at the things that want to be seen.

The nights are long here — sometimes longer than they should be. Lights never quite cut through the fog, and conversations always seem to end just before someone says too much.

Yet, for all its decay, there's an undeniable pulse beneath Haven's grime.

The city rewards boldness, luck, and the right kind of madness. People who make their own opportunities — detectives, hustlers, occultists, liars — they're the ones who rise above the noise, even if it's just for a moment before the city drags them back down.

Every alley has a secret. Every rainstorm hides a truth.

And every truth in Haven comes with a price tag.

## Districts

### Old Haven
Rust, rain, superstition. Poor part of the town. Old folk remember the days when Haven was prosperous without the "outsiders"

### Downtown
Jazz, neon, and cigarette haze. Where the living and the "weird" drink side by side.

### The Edges
Junkyards, forgotten factories, empty mines. Things move there when no one's looking.

### New Haven
Where the rich pretend the lights don't hum wrong. The heart of the technological progress in Haven.

Between them all, the city hums — like a machine too big for anyone to shut off.

## Crime and Factions

In Haven, power isn't held — it's bartered.

Crime isn't just part of the city; it's the language everyone speaks. From small-time fixers to megacorp executives, everyone's in on some scheme, some hustle, some little sin to keep the lights on.

### Haven PD

The police will tell you they're in control — that Haven PD keeps order. That's a lie everyone politely agrees to. The PD is stretched thin, underfunded, and half the precincts are owned by the people they're supposed to arrest. Their detectives drink too much, their rookies don't last long, and their "special investigations" unit quietly files anything supernatural under unsolved and classified. Still, a few good cops remain — relics of integrity in a city that eats it alive.

### Neon Corporation

Then there's Neon Corporation — the smiling face of progress. They wire the city, illuminate the streets, and promise a brighter tomorrow. But their fingers are in everything: data, pharmaceuticals, private security, even rumor-tracking. Most citizens see Neon as a necessary evil — and they're not wrong. The corporation keeps Haven alive, but it also keeps it dependent.

### The White Skulls

Below the corporate glow, you find the street players — groups that rose from desperation and fury. The White Skulls, led by an ex-cop turned demonologist, claim to fight for justice by their own brutal code. Their vigilante raids have become urban legends — righteous thunder rolling through the rain.

### Glass Jackal's Devotees

Meanwhile, the Glass Jackal's devotees move like a reflection no one wants to see. They spread misinformation, bend truth to profit, and whisper in mirrors. Nobody knows their full structure — only that every time they're exposed, a new name surfaces in their place.

### Others

And between them all: fixers, smugglers, and brokers who sell information instead of bullets.

Every secret in Haven has a market value. Every rumor can shift power.

In this city, law is a suggestion, justice is a story, and truth is the most dangerous currency of all.

To survive, you don't need to be righteous — you just need to be clever enough to stay one step ahead of whoever's buying.

## Points of Interest in Haven

### Old Haven

#### The Knotted Oak
A massive, twisted tree fenced in by rusted chain links. Locals treat it like a park, leaving offerings at its roots — old coins, photos, and notes. The city council once ordered it removed, but the contractor backed out without refund. And no one knows why.

#### Lantern Row
The oldest street in Haven, long and uneven lined with century-old apartments. Almost every balcony has a lantern, some lit, some not. People swear they flicker in unison during storms.

#### Copper Mule
A community center turned into a shabby bar. Local workers hang here after a long day of work. Despite its old look and tough looking crowd, it's a decent place to grab a drink and have an honest talk with a stranger.

### Downtown

#### Haven Square
The busiest plaza in the city. Shops, caffes and Neon Corp adds litter the place. Old clocktower is showing the wrong time of the day, again. Feels like the perfect mix of old times and the new.

#### The Bell House
A smooth jazz lounge tucked in the corner of the district, where city's lowlifes and high rollers mingle over whiskey and soft jazz. Some people mentioned that the owner of the place new their names before they introduced themselves.

#### The Haven Daily
The city's oldest and most persistent newspaper — a patchwork of real journalism, corporate fluff, and public fear management. Once the voice of the people, now it's a daily compromise between truth and survival.

### The Edges

#### The Ash Yard
A massive industrial dump full of scorched cars and twisted scaffolding. The official story is an electrical fire; the power company insists they were never connected.

#### Delver Industrial Storage
An old warehouse complex that still works, barely. They scrape by from old contracts and occasional donation from Neon Corp. The company's records department burned down decades ago.

#### Rail 9
A derailed train car half-buried in the dirt, never cleared because no one agrees whose jurisdiction it falls under. Locals treat it like a landmark.

### New Haven

#### Halcyon Club
A private, members-only establishment for the powerful. Its quiet interior and curt staff make it the perfect place for backroom deals and corporate betrayals. Getting in is not an easy task, for a regular human.

#### Meridian Promenade
The new street that has started to gain traction, especially among the young who are starting to learn the technology. Computer caffe shops and arcane games are the new attractions.

#### The Neon Headquarters
The tallest building in Haven, twelve stories high, stands as a proud monument of the corporate's accomplishments. Some say it s the only place in the city that never sleeps.
