# Character Creation

Follow these steps to create your character for H.A.V.E.N.

## Character Creation Steps

### 1. Choose Calling

Select one of the five [[Callings]]:
- [[Callings#private-investigator|Private Investigator]]
- [[Callings#rumormonger|Rumormonger]]
- [[Callings#haunted-one|Haunted One]]
- [[Callings#the-agent|The Agent]]
- [[Callings#demonologist|Demonologist]]

### 2. Apply Starting Bonuses

Apply starting bonuses to stat pools based on your Calling.

### 3. Assign Attribute Points

#### Physical Pool
- [[Core-Rules#attributes|Brawn]]
- [[Core-Rules#attributes|Agility]]
- [[Core-Rules#attributes|Endurance]]

#### Mental Pool
- [[Core-Rules#attributes|Intellect]]
- [[Core-Rules#attributes|Charisma]]
- [[Core-Rules#attributes|Willpower]]

Start with 1 in each stat, distribute 5 additional points to each pool, not including Calling bonuses.

### 4. Set Stamina & Recovery

Set Stamina & Recovery based on your Calling. They represent endurance during missions and determine how much is regained after scene or downtime (with "take a breather" action).

### 5. Define Conviction / Iron-Clad Rule

A personal goal, drive, or code the character follows. Guides roleplay and moral choices in the noir city.

### 6. Choose Dark Secret

Hidden truth that haunts the character. Can be revealed once per campaign trigger major narrative beat.

### 7. Set Influence & Luck

[[Core-Rules#influence|Influence]]: Track reputation, faction leverage, narrative sway.

[[Core-Rules#luck|Luck]]: Points for rerolling dice or daring actions in dire situations (last resort).

These start at 0.

### 8. Establish Cash Tier

Determine starting financial tier (1â€“5). Tracks resources for equipment, healing, favors.

See [[Core-Rules#cash--economy|Cash & Economy]] for details.

### 9. Select Traits / Bonuses

Pick 1 starting [[Character-Traits|Trait]] reflecting background, skill, or profession. Traits give mechanical bonuses and narrative hooks; can evolve as experience is gained.

### 10. Determine Starting Reputation

Assign initial [[Core-Rules#reputation|reputation]] with factions, organizations, or key NPCs.

- Positive = bonus dice, friendly relations
- Negative = complications or hostility

### 11. Finalize Narrative Details

Personal appearance, key NPC relationships, haunted locations, and narrative quirks. Optional: minor flavor elements to tie into neon-noir city.

### 12. Calculate Dice Pools

**Physical Pool**: Brawn + Agility + Endurance

**Mental Pool**: Intellect + Charisma + Willpower

These pools are used for task rolls during missions. You can write the values on the sheet or use the d6 dice to pool them on the side of your sheet.
