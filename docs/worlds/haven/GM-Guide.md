# GM Guide

As GM, your goal isn't to beat the players — it's to be the city.

Haven is atmospheric, reactive, and alive.

## GM Principles

- Always ask, "What does the city want?"
- Reward boldness, not perfection. But also, good preparation.
- Make complications meaningful, not punitive.
- Use the [[Core-Rules#chaos-pool|Chaos Pool]] to show the city's hand.
- Every success should reveal another secret.

---

## When to Roll

Rolls happen when outcomes are uncertain and interesting.

If failure wouldn't matter — don't roll.

If success feels too easy, raise the stakes or add tension.

---

## Using Chaos

Treat Chaos as pacing.

If the session drags or needs spice — add a die.

If the players push their luck — add a die.

If something weird should happen — roll the pool.

See [[Core-Rules#chaos-pool|Chaos Pool]] for mechanics.

---

## Consequences

Failures and partial successes move the story forward.

Never stop play — change direction instead.

**Examples:**

- "You succeed, but the evidence is destroyed."
- "You find the cultist, but he's already dead."
- "You escape — but they know your name now."

---

## Tone and Play Philosophy

H.A.V.E.N. is about:

- **Narrative Freedom** – players create as much as they uncover.
- **Moral Ambiguity** – every truth is dangerous.
- **Survival** – both physical and psychological.
- **Atmosphere** – noir, occult, and psychological tension.

Play isn't about winning. It's about how much of yourself you leave behind in the rain.

## GM-ing Callings and Player Actions

In H.A.V.E.N., the players' [[Callings]] and their actions are the pulse of the story. Your role as GM isn't to control them, but to frame their impact — to keep the tension, tone, and mystery alive. Every roll, decision, or ability should leave a mark on the city, for better or worse.

### Player Actions

When players act, they roll dice from their Physical or Mental pool based on the situation. Before the roll, set the stakes — what can be gained, what can be lost, what could twist in the dark. Remember, players should roll only when there is potential consequence, since they exhaust the dice on rolled 1.

A roll should never just mean success or failure. It's how the world reacts that matters.

Even when players succeed, describe the cost, the noise, or the unease it leaves behind. The city always notices. The roll 1's on Mental Dice pool can sometimes feel hard to explain. Do not be afraid to add some weirdness or unease, with later paranormal payoff. Players will often take the narrative reigns, so you must be able to adapt sometimes.

### Influence

[[Core-Rules#influence|Influence]] is the player's leverage — their power to rewrite the story in small, believable ways.

When a player spends Influence, they're claiming narrative authority: changing a detail in advance, or bending the odds their way.

Say yes — then weave the consequence.

Big changes attract attention, alter faction relations, or stir unseen forces.

Influence shouldn't erase tension; it should reshape it.

Player might spend one Influence to say "there is a fire escape ladder on the side of the building" or "The bouncer in the club will let anyone in". The influence should feel meaningful, but minor.

### Luck Rolls

[[Core-Rules#luck|Luck]] is a desperate whisper to the city — a plea for one good break.

When a player makes a Luck roll, slow down. Let the table feel that silence before fate answers.

A success should feel narrow and cinematic: a gun jams, a car door unlocks, a light turns red at the perfect moment. A failure should feel meaningful: a stumble, a twist of timing, or cruel irony.

Player might not choose to roll Luck to often. But if a players pool gets lower, his luck might be higher and if the narrative is right luck roll might get them out of tough situation.

It is important that players understand this, Luck Roll is a last resort, but you might have a player that rolls it just for the sake of the narrative. And that is good.

Each time when a player rolls a successful Luck Roll, reward them. Give them one influence, or if you are playing a shorter campaign 2 or 3 experience.

### Player Abilities

Abilities are extensions of who the characters are — how they see, think, and survive.

When players use one, treat it like a spotlight moment. Let it define their personality and the tone of the scene. Encourage them to describe what their ability looks like or feels like.

Tie its outcome into other systems — it might exhaust dice, add to the [[Core-Rules#preparation-pool|Preparation Pool]], or tempt [[Core-Rules#chaos-pool|Chaos]].

Abilities are sometimes intentionally made vague. The interpretation of the ability is on the GM and the player. Feel free to give players what they want.

For example, when Rumormonger makes different personalities for his ability "secret identity" allow player to go wild. In one of my playtests a player had a Russian Investigator as one and French Writer as another. In other playtest, one was a business woman and another a lady of the night.

It is amazing if the players are allowed to add their own flavor to their characters how they see fit. But, of course without crossing any boundaries.

### Preparation Pool

The [[Core-Rules#preparation-pool|Preparation Pool]] is the team's collective foresight — the evidence of careful planning, smart connections, and sheer confidence.

As GM, use it to measure how ready they are for what's coming.

**Add dice to the Pool when:**

- Players gather useful intel or resources.
- They make clever deductions or take extra time to prepare.
- A Calling ability explicitly creates advantage or order.
- Any other situation you think would be advantageous to the players.

Players can spend these dice at any time to improve their rolls or declare "prepared" items, flashbacks, or contingencies.

When they do, reward them for playing smart — not for playing safe.

When players are using the preparation dices to add to the roll, there is no need to ask them "how they prepared" but you can always suggest to your players if they wish to do so. Add more flavor to the scene.

And don't forget, added dice prevent exhausting dices on 1's. So if a player took 1 prep die and rolled a 2 1's, he or she would exhaust only one die. This reflects the preparedness of the players as they play.

When a player wishes to make a retroactive statement, he or she will state the way they have prepared. You then decide the cost, one or two preparation dice. Stronger effects should always cost two, while weaker, more predictable should cost 1.

**For example:** The team enters a condemned warehouse. The PI says, "We packed flashlights." They spend 1 Prep die. Or the party stumbles unexpectedly on a locked door, a player might want to "add" lockpicks to his pocket and they spend two dice from the preparation pool.

Lastly, When the players wish to use their Signature Ability, they need to spend three dice from the preparation pool and GM adds one chaos die to the chaos pool.

If the team's prep was strong, add dice freely. If they acted rashly or skipped clues, keep it lean.

Preparation Dice carry the story's momentum — when they're gone, the players feel the city's teeth.

### The Chaos Pool

The [[Core-Rules#chaos-pool|Chaos Pool]] represents Haven's will — the unpredictable pulse of the city, the grinding gears beneath the streets, the quiet rage of things left forgotten. It's not a punishment system; it's how the world reminds the players that every action leaves ripples.

You add one die to the Chaos Pool when something tilts the balance of control — when order falters, reality bends, or the city takes notice.

**Add one (and only one) die for moments such as:**

- A significant failure or bad choice that shifts the situation.
- A risky shortcut or reckless decision.
- The use of powers that twist reality or attract attention.
- The group ignoring warnings, omens, or debts.
- The world simply responding — a cold wind, a shadow moving wrong, a radio hissing back.

The key is rhythm. Three to five dice gained over a mission is enough to make the table feel the tension without drowning in it.

When the Pool reaches five dice, the GM rolls them all together. The results determine the severity and nature of the world's backlash. It's not always violence — sometimes it's omen, distortion, or misfortune. It should always change the tone of the story.

| Pattern | Outcome |
|---------|---------|
| Pair | Strange omen or small setback. |
| Two Pairs / Three of a Kind | Complication or interference. |
| Full House / Four of a Kind | Major turn — a faction acts, or a haunting worsens. |
| Five of a Kind | Catastrophe — the city bites back. Reality bends. |

Chaos events don't have to target the players directly. Sometimes the city just shifts around them: lights flicker, an alley shortens, someone they met before doesn't remember them. Other times, the Chaos hits hard — a gunfight, a collapse, a curse reawakens.

**Chaos is your pacing tool.**

Use it to mark turning points — when things get strange, when tension peaks, when the story pivots. If the players are comfortable for too long, that's when the city breathes in.

If they're pushing their luck, that's when it breathes out.

Chaos doesn't punish cleverness — it punishes complacency. Make it poetic. Make it cinematic. The world is alive, and it's tired of pretending it isn't.

### Signature Abilities

Signature Abilities are the crown jewels of the [[Callings]] — powers that bend the story around the player's identity. They are not mechanical shortcuts; they are cinematic shifts in tone and reality.

Signatures are not "get-out-of-trouble" cards. They are pivots in the narrative. When a player uses theirs talk it out with them, see what is their idea, and how they want to approach it. As the GM, your role is to encourage creative freedom, honor the player's intent, and weave the consequences.

Signature Abilities are open-ended by design. Let players be bold, inventive, and specific. Their actions can introduce new characters, rewrite small pieces of the story, or create surreal outcomes.

Never reduce these moments to dice math — instead, ask questions that invite cinematic detail:

- "What does it look like when reality bends for you?"
- "What part of Haven changes because of this act?"
- "What kind of narrative shift is going to happen?"

When a Signature is used, step back from the narrative and allow player to describe what he wishes to accomplish. Your task is to mediate and offer suggestions to the players idea. Let them be the "GM" in the moment. If you feel that the player is going overboard or stepping out of the signature ability bounds, tell them to rethink the approach. Each callings signature ability has its own flavor.

Here are some examples, but use these as guidelines or examples:

#### Rumormonger: Fact or Fiction

The player declares the truth in a form of the rumor that will within 24 hours change the narrative and become the truth. The format of the rumor needs to be framed as something interesting, something that will make people talk about it.

Encourage creativity, but remember. Rumormonger cannot directly harm or influence individuals, but can twist the circumstances.

A player might use this ability to say that tomorrow at 9 p.m. the electric company will perform tests on the grid and create a power outage for 15 minutes, giving the party enough time to infiltrate the warehouse complex.

**Or,**

At one of my sessions, players were trying to find someone who is knowledgeable about ancient books and scripts. So, the Rumormonger spread a rumor that there will be a book fair at the Old Haven City Hall, in hope that someone they were looking for would be there. (Give the players what they want, but also introduce complications).

Both of these would be the talk of the town. First as annoyance, and the second one something positive for the book people.

#### The Agent: Dimensional Incursion

The Agent tears through a veil between realities — stepping sideways into a parallel world of their choosing. The player describes what this location might look in a different reality or what tool he is trying to procure from it. He is not teleporting to a different location, just shifting the one which he already occupies.

A player might say, that the abandoned apartment is a pharmacy in another reality and jump in for a quick first aid kit to bandage the wounds of his team mate.

**Or,**

He might jump into a reality where a building has not yet been erected so he can easily pass the locked door and unlock it form the other side.

If a player does not wish to "jump" into another reality, but has a really cool idea that works with dimensions allow for it to happen.

#### Private Investigator: Calling in Favors

The Private Eye calls onto a debt or favor long due. The player invents an NPC, name, occupation and connection. Even the debt or how they know the person. That person does not appear out of nowhere, they were always in the city. But now the PI needs their help.

This NPC is now the part of the story, if you are playing a campaign, or a case in multiple sessions he can be contacted again and be an asset, or potentially a liability to the party.

In one of my sessions the party found some chemical substance on the scene and wanted to investigate it. The PI has used the ability to call in favor from a Chemist. Who then proceeded to help them with analyzing the substance.

**Or,**

The players need access to a VIP club, the PI might make up contact who can arrange that, one time. Maybe then that NPC gets into trouble?

#### The Haunted One: Ghost in the Wires

The spirit companion that is haunting the player does a possession of the players choosing. Objects, machines or even corpses are target. The player describes how it manifests. The ability will happen as the player wishes it to, but consider the ghosts feelings, and what kind of relationship it has with the player.

Maybe the ghost feel tortured by the player character and behaves erratically or they have a good relationship and he is willing to help.

The party needs an express getaway and find a old car that it wont start. The Haunted One uses the ability and the ghost possesses the car, starting it up. It will drive, but how well depends on the ghost and the car.

**Or,**

The party wishes to contact an off-site ally. The ghost possesses the telephone wire and call the ally, leaving a message that the party requires his aid immediately. Maybe even creating a two-way communication between the player and the ally.

#### Demonologist: The Devil's Clause

The Demonologist invokes their pact, channeling the presence of their contract demon into the world to alter it. Just as any other signature ability, this should feel powerful. But remember to keep it in the tone of the contracted demon. The personality of the demon is important, as is the end goal of the activated ability. Power is important, but so is the relationship between the demon and Demonologist.

Taranis contractee might use this ability to create a thunderous voice, yelling to all enemies in the area that they need to surrender or get killed.

**Or,**

Glass Jackal contractee might create an illusion of the whole party to throw off the pursuers.

Remember, in all of the instances it all about the narrative advantage. You should rarely, if ever allow the player to use any signature ability to recover their pool or add something to the preparation pool. Even if you allow such a thing, keep it at "only this time" moments.

## Running the Game

You're not telling a story about the players — you're telling a story with them. Let their actions shape the world. Let their failures matter as much theirs victories do.

Think of yourself as the city's will, not its god. You play the people, the ghosts, the factions, the weather. You set the tone — from backroom deals dripping in cigarette haze to the distant echo of something shifting beneath the asphalt.

One thing that I would like to mention and I believe this is important. The HAVEN rpg allows players to add their own narrative elements to the game, and as a GM that could potentially prove challenging. Preparing the session and having players bypass the clues or moments you prepared could feel unrewarding for you as the GM.

They'll call in favors, twist truths, rewrite small parts of reality, or pull unexpected stunts you never saw coming.

That's not a flaw in the system. It's the system working. The city itself bends around willpower and coincidence — it's alive, unpredictable, and reactive.

But that means your prep has to breathe.

If you plan HAVEN like a straight line, the players will break it. So, instead, plan situations, motives, and timers, not scripts.

So, here are some tips on how to approach the prep and running the game. These I hope will help you. But if you have your own style that works, that is excellent. The point here is me trying to ease your sessions if you are struggling, if not that is even better. And every GM has its own flavor and style, so each HAVEN campaign should as well.

So here we go:

### 1. Prepare Loose, Not Light

Think in terms of webs, not scripts. Before a session, note down:

- **People**: Who wants what, and how far they'll go for it.
- **Places**: 2–3 locations that fit the tone — an abandoned motel, a factory office, a jazz bar where everyone whispers.
- **Pressures**: What happens if the players do nothing?

That's enough. You don't need to know exactly how they'll uncover the truth — only what happens if they don't.

### 2. When Players Change the Story

When someone uses a Signature Ability, drops a rumor, or rewrites a small detail, don't think: "They skipped my plan." Think: "They just handed me a new thread."

**Reframe, don't reset.**

- If they "Call in a Favor" to get through a locked door — great. Who did that favor owe something to?
- If they "Fact or Fiction" a lead into existence — perfect. That rumor draws attention from someone new who was not in the narrative before.
- If they "Dimensional Jump" out of danger — fine. Something else crawled through with them.

Every player rewrite is an opening for new consequences and new clues. Use Chaos or faction reactions to fold their action back into the story.

### 3. Keep Improvisation Grounded

Improvising in HAVEN doesn't mean making things up wildly — it means listening to what the table gives you and echoing it back through the city's tone.

- **Echo the mood**. If players are tense, make the environment mirror it — radios static, shadows move.
- **Reincorporate details**. That name they dropped earlier? Have it show up on a police report.
- **Let the consequences breathe**. Not every twist has to land immediately. Write a note — "This will come back next session."

Improvisation works best when it feels planned in hindsight.

### 4. Turn Their Freedom into Tension

When players use powerful abilities, reward creativity — but remind them nothing in HAVEN comes clean. Every shortcut leaves fingerprints. Every lie changes the story. Let them win the moment, then make that win echo. It's a tug of war of successes and failures, truths and lies.

You can't "lose control" of HAVEN because you never truly have it. You and the players are co-directors in a city that already has a will of its own. If your prep is flexible, your tone consistent, and your consequences honest, the story will never break — it will just shift into a shape you didn't expect.

That's not chaos. That's Haven doing its job.

---

## Running Missions and Downtime

Every HAVEN story moves like a pendulum — swinging between the quiet tension of Downtime and the sharp chaos of Missions.

Downtime is where the characters breathe, remember who they are, and make choices that will haunt them later. Missions are where those choices come due.

### Downtime: The Quiet Between Storms

Downtime isn't just rest — it's recovery with consequences.

It's when players can patch their wounds, mend their relationships, or plan for what's coming next. But Haven never truly sleeps. Every calm moment hums with tension — debts, rumors, and unresolved whispers pressing in.

**As a GM, use Downtime to:**

- Show the cost of their previous choices. Let them see what changed in the city.
- Ask questions. "Who do you visit?" "What do you owe?" "What's still keeping you up at night?"
- Shift Factions. Maybe their last job made them friends in one district and enemies in another.

Encourage your players to narrate what rest looks like for them. Is it a bottle in a quiet apartment? A séance in a backroom chapel? A fight club in an abandoned factory?

Reward those moments — mechanically or narratively — by refilling their pools, adjusting reputation, awarding experience or influence or revealing leads for the next job.

**Downtime Options for Players:**

- **Mend wounds**: Restore dice with a night's rest or spend Cash for full rest.
- **Indulge Vice**: Lose a Cash tier for Influence, Prep, or Luck (depending on how they blow it).
- **Reach Out**: Use Reputations to pull favors or gather rumors about new cases.
- **Prepare**: Contribute narrative details or plans that add dice to the next Mission's Preparation Pool.
- **Reflect**: Reveal a sliver of a Dark Secret to another character — earn 1 Influence or Luck.
- **Any other options players can think of**, Gm should allow the players to express their characters.

Keep downtime freeform — let players pick how many scenes they want. End it when they stop feeling safe or when they choose.

If you feel that they are "overpreparing" hit them with a complication or a deadline. AS the players rest and engage in low stakes activities the city is still moving, breathing and waits for no one.

### Missions: Where the City Bites Back

Missions are the heartbeat of HAVEN. They're jobs, cases, hunts, or exorcisms — the moments when the neon glow feels too bright and the city feels too close.

When prepping a Mission, think in three beats instead of plot points:

1. **The Hook** – Who's hiring them, what's the goal, and what's at stake?
2. **The Complication** – Something the players didn't know about.
3. **The Fallout** – The cost of success (or failure).

That's it. Everything else will come alive through rolls, improvisation, and the players' abilities.

**How to Run a Mission**

- Open with a scene of atmosphere. Let them see the place — the fog, the jazz, the flickering light.
- Offer meaningful choices early. A job should always have more than one way in — force, stealth, negotiation, deceit.
- Reward cleverness, not perfection. Even when they succeed, something shifts. Every roll should carry some consequence.

During Missions, use these tools to manage rhythm and tension:

- **Preparation Pool** – Represents foresight, planning, and luck. Players can spend from it to tip odds or retcon smart prep. Replenish it when their ideas are clever, bold, or cinematic.
- **Chaos Pool** – Represents the city's attention. Add to it when players get reckless or fail dramatically. When it fills, something moves in the dark.
- Remember that the narrative takes priority to the mechanics (you should still play by the rules), but if you are not sure how to rule something bend the rules to fit the story, or moment.

**Example of Flow:**

The players are investigating a nightclub tied to an occult ring.

Their planning added 5 dice to the Preparation Pool.

A failed social roll adds one to Chaos.

They decide to "call in a favor" (Private Eye's ability), bypassing your planned informant scene.

No problem — that favor leads to someone even more dangerous.

Prep drains. Chaos grows. The job twists.

### Ending a Mission

Missions in HAVEN don't always end when the objective is complete — they end when the players decide the job is done. Sometimes that means a victory; other times it's a retreat under flickering lights and the sound of sirens.

Players are always allowed to end a mission on their own terms. If they feel stuck, if their dice pools are drained, or if the situation has turned too dangerous, they can choose to pull out — regroup, recover, and face the fallout later.

But walking away has consequences. The city doesn't pause for anyone. Unfinished jobs evolve on their own: evidence goes missing, witnesses disappear, factions lose faith, or the Chaos Pool grows as Haven itself shifts to fill the vacuum they left behind.

When the mission ends — whether in triumph, collapse, or retreat — take a moment to show the cost:

- Who was affected?
- What changed while they were gone?
- Which doors are now closed — and which ones just opened a crack?

Then resolve the end-of-mission steps:

- Award Experience (3–5, +2 for completion).
- Adjust Reputation or Cash tiers if their actions warranted it.
- Let each player narrate what "coming back to the city" looks like — whether that's a quiet night, a drink, or a haunting silence.

A mission doesn't have to end cleanly. In HAVEN, it rarely does.

The important part is that it ends on purpose — when the players decide the risk has outweighed the reward, or when the city itself forces their hand.

This playtest is intended for one-time sessions, or one case scenarios that end in 1-2 sessions. But there is an option for long term play with some very light progression mechanics. If you engage in a longer form of play, give players an option to get a new trait when they tick all the experience boxes or allow them to get some other bonus.

My suggestion would be, if you play multiple sessions with the same characters, to space the cases a month or two, give the city and the characters room for breathing, and get the party together a month or two later for a new case. Ask them, what has changed, and how has your character grown?

## Short GM Tips for Running HAVEN

- Add one Chaos die at a time; never skip straight to the fallout.
- Resolve Chaos only when five dice are in the pool — make the result felt, not explained.
- Reward clever or cinematic planning with +1 Prep die — not perfect plans.
- One roll is enough to resolve a clear action; extra rolls mean new risks.
- Track Reputation loosely; make it visible through how NPCs treat them.
- Always have five names ready — Haven's full of people who'll get in the way.
- When in doubt, make something flicker.
- Let players feel smart; make them pay for it later.
- One gunfight per session is enough — tension matters more than bullets.
- Shotgun to the face means instant death, no roll required.
- Give every NPC a motive and maybe one visible flaw.
- Let the players retreat — the city will remember.
- Players roll only when failure or strain matters — talk through everything else.
- Luck rolls are last resorts — make the stakes crystal clear before rolling.
- Cash tiers shift through story, not bookkeeping.
- Each Calling should feel unique in what rule it bends — encourage that power.
- When a Signature Ability is used, treat it as a story event — spotlight it.
