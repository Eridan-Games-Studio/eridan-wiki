# Callings

Callings are archetypes — your role, worldview, and special toolkit in Haven.

They grant unique ways to bend the rules of the city.

Each Calling has:

- **Signature Ability** (costs 3 Preparation Dice and GM adds the die to the Chaos pool, alters the narrative directly).
- **Ability List** (In playtest each Calling has 4)
- **Starting Cash & Reputation options**.

## Private Investigator

The city never sleeps, but you've learned how to follow its whispers. Maybe you were a cop once, maybe just a stubborn fool with a trench coat and a notepad — either way, you know how to pull at threads until the truth bleeds through.

**You gain +1 to Brawn or Agility, Willpower and Stamina.**

### Starting Cash
Tier 2 (Scraping by). You scrape by on small jobs and favors. Bills are always nipping at your heels, but you're not starving—yet. You are suited with a small apartment or office. Combined with a car, the standard PI license, gun and tape recorder. Plus, any mundane items you can think of, such as flashlight, bottle of whiskey, etc.

### Reputation Options

Choose one of the following at [[Character-Creation|character creation]]:

**+1 Reputation with Haven PD.** You have contacts in the precinct, but a notable police commissioner hates your guts and will gladly make your life harder.

**–1 Reputation with Haven PD.** The department doesn't like or trust you, but one commissioner is a good friend and occasionally bends the rules to help you out.

### Signature Ability – Calling in Favors

Spend 3 [[Core-Rules#preparation-pool|Preparation dice]] to establish a contact, informant, or group you "just happen to know." Describe the GM who he is, and what does he do (or do it together). Those people will almost always help you out, sometimes even when it goes out of their way. But such actions can provide consequences, for you and for them. You can add that contact to your character sheet; he is now part of the narrative.

### Trigger ready

Whenever you are surprised by an action, or GM reveals a threat, you may expend one Preparation Die to act first, before the action GM announced. (Attack, dodge, tackle, hide.) If you would suffer consequences in form of Wounds or Exhausting a die, you remove one die less (to a minimum of 0) Once per session you may use this ability for free, but each subsequent use costs one [[Core-Rules#luck|Luck]].

### Molded by the City (Choose One):

#### Back Alley Brawler
When fighting unarmed or with improvised weapons, ignore the first 1 on a Brawl roll. Additionally, once per mission you can use a Luck point to reroll your whole Brawl roll instead of 1 dice.

#### Good Aim
When you are shooting a firearm, you can add dice to your roll equal to your Agility +1. First time you shoot on a mission you can ignore the first 1 you rolled (do not exhaust the die)

### Sharp Eye

Once per scene, when making a roll to notice details, investigate or spot hidden elements, add 1 extra dice to your roll (from outside of the game). If you have not exhausted any die, put that die to the Preparation Pool.

### Gut Feeling

Once per mission, before making a roll, you may declare that you have a gut feeling about a situation, person, or place. Roll without using any dice from the preparation pool, just your raw intuition. If you succeed, you may alter one detail from the GM's description to reflect what your instincts reveal — a subtle truth that was missed, a hidden clue, or a false lead corrected. Regardless of the outcome, add 1 die to the preparation pool.

---

## Rumormonger

You are a rare individual who can twist reality by weaving whispers into truth. Perhaps it's an old tradition, an accident, a gift from something vast and unfathomable, or a secret you dug out of forbidden knowledge. But your ability to change the world depends on the many little gossips and stories that people tell throughout the day. You might profit from this ability, or use it only when desperate — but either way, powers and predators alike would kill to control you.

**You gain +1 to two of the mental scores and recovery.**

### Starting Cash
Tier 3 (Comfortable): Rumormongers thrive on secrets, and secrets sell. Whether through whispered blackmail, discreet information brokering or any other means you see fit. You have a decent apartment, sharp clothes, and enough money to keep up appearances.

### Reputation options

**+1 Reputation with a "Whisper Network"** an organization or group that deals in information brokering, but Haven PD suspects one of your identities (if you have two) is in some shady business.

**-1 Reputation with a "Whisper Network"**, some organization considers you untrusty or even dangerous, but you have a local Journalist Friend who is fascinated by you and loves to share info or help.

### Signature Ability – Fact or Fiction

Spend 3 Preparation dice to weave a rumor into reality. Tell the GM a statement about the world, a situation, or a future event, and if it's plausible and interesting enough that people would actually talk about it, it becomes true. These rumors can change the flow of a mission, open opportunities, or tilt circumstances in your favor. They cannot directly harm a person or force their will—no rumor can kill, heal, or mind-control—but they can create situations where harm might follow. (Example: you can't declare "the rival boss drops dead," but you could declare "the rival boss never shows up at the meeting," leaving the fallout to play out naturally.) Rumors usually take about 24 hours to spread, but the GM might reduce that time if the idea is particularly juicy. Some rumors might require you to lower your [[Core-Rules#cash--economy|Cash Tier]], since a rumor to make a 1000$ worth of gold would cost that much money.

### Secret Identity

You have a fully-formed second persona — complete with papers, accounts, and alibis. (Make up the name and the personality). It takes you 1 hour to swap the identity on downtime, but you can always spend 1 preparation dice to do it in a minute (you need to be alone). You have an extra die that you assign to one of the 6 stats, when you swap, you can move that die to another stat. This stat increase both your pool and the value of that stat by 1. (Decide those stats when taking this ability)

### Unspoken Message

You can send a message to anyone in Haven, and through strange coincidences or unseen hands, it always arrives. This works across long distances or in your immediate vicinity. You must know the recipient's name. Once per session, you may use this ability freely. To send additional messages, spend 1 Luck. This message is always written and can find itself in most peculiar places.

### Always Come Prepared

At the start of each mission, add one die to the preparation pool. If you recently spread a rumor regarding this mission (it is related in some way) you also gain one Luck. When the GM describes the start of the mission you may add one small detail to the narrative (as if you had spent [[Core-Rules#influence|Influence]]).

### Well Informed

When rolling intellect roll to gather information about recent events, crimes, or occult activity, you may spend luck to reroll the any number of dice instead of 1. If you exhaust at least one die, you may once per session place it in the preparation pool instead of removing it.

## Demonologist

The Demonologist is a Calling defined by their pacts with infernal beings. Unlike other Callings, whose powers come from personal training or worldly influence, the Demonologist's strength lies in mutual contracts with demons. These pacts grant unique abilities, but the Demonologist also has their own inherent toolkit, reflecting their role as negotiator, occult scholar, and threshold figure between the human and the supernatural.

**You gain +1 to any stat and +1 to stamina or recovery.**

### Starting Cash
Tier 2 (Scraping by). Demonologists usually live simply, funneling money into occult tools, offerings, or bizarre rituals rather than wealth. They aren't destitute, but their lifestyle is eccentric and unsustainable by ordinary means. You have a cheap flat and perhaps a vehicle, like a scooter or bike.

### Reputation Options

**Gain +1 reputation** with the creatures of your contract type. But you support them through extra offerings and start with one lower tier in Cash.

**You do not meddle into demonic business** too much and have no reputation modifiers here, but have +1 reputation with good friend that works in museum or academy.

### Signature Ability – The Devil's Clause

Spend 3 Preparation dice to invoke the power of your contracted being. Each demon has its own flavor, and when you are manifesting, it has to be in that flavor. For example: Taranis pact-holder calls in a sudden thunderstorm to scatter pursuers, or to create a block wide blackout. Or Glass Jackal might create an illusion that would turn the odds to your favor.

### Otherworldly Sense

Once per scene you stop and "listen" for the unseen. GM gives you a vague impression of any recent paranormal or demonic presence in the area (unsettling feelings, distorted sounds, cryptic imagery). This information is suggestive but never concrete. You may spend one dice from the Preparation pool to ask the GM one question that he will answer truthfully.

When creating a Demonologist, you start with a contract made with one of the demonic entities:

### Choose Taranis or Glass Jackal:

### Taranis – The Thunder-bound

Taranis is a storm spirit, booming with pride and quick to temper. He thrives on decisive action and direct confrontation, revering mortals who wield strength without fear. He despises hesitation, cowardice, and those who "smother" fire or lightning. While destructive, he is not reckless — storms always strike with purpose.

**Gain +1 to Endurance**

#### Electrocute
By exhausting one die from your physical pool, you jolt a nearby enemy or device. Humanoid enemy is knocked unconscious, and device is powered up or short circuited for a couple of minutes.

#### Storms Favor
If it is raining at the beginning of a mission add 1 prep die to the preparation pool and gain 1 luck. Once per mission you may automatically succeed on a physical roll as if you rolled a 6.

#### Lightning Jolt
By exhausting two dice from your physical pool, you are able to move/react at storm-speed for a heartbeat. You can dodge a bullet, outrun pursuers, close gap or grab something before someone.

### Glass Jackal – The Mirror hound

The Glass Jackal is sly, elegant, and unnerving — a trickster that sees truth as nothing more than fractured reflections. It adores illusions, double meanings, and social games, but scorns brute force and honesty. To the Jackal, every mask hides a better story, and every reflection conceals a hidden flaw waiting to be exploited.

**Gain +1 to Charisma.**

#### Forked tongue
Once per mission you may spend an influence to tell a character a lie. That character now believes that to be true. You cannot direct him how to act though.

#### Splintered lies
By gazing into a reflection of a character (mirror, glass, water), you can discern if someone is lying; Jackal shows up in the reflection of liars.

#### Mirror double
Spend one prep die to create a fragile illusory copy of yourself that distracts enemies or acts as bait. If struck, it shatters into shards of light.

## The Agent

A man out of place. A woman between worlds. No one's quite sure how you got here — maybe not even you. Maybe a paranormal rupture hurled you across realities, or maybe you were part of an experiment gone wrong. You walk the streets of Haven with the reflexes of a soldier and the instincts of a ghost, adapting faster than most can think. Some call you a Jack of all trades, others a temporal mistake. You just call it another job. Whether you're serving a shadowy patron, tracking something that slipped through the cracks, or simply biding your time in this world, one thing's certain: you don't belong here… but you work here.

**You gain +1 to two of the physical scores and stamina.**

### Starting Cash
Tier 3 (Comfortable). Even though you came from somewhere else, you are a capable man and have found ways to obtain a suitable number of resources for good living. You have a decent place to stay, with the small workshop, an older car of a bike and a unique gadget you brought from your original place of origin. Decide with the GM what it is. (Maybe a compass that always points to the wealthiest person in the room, or polaroid camera that can tell people's emotions in the picture).

### Reputation options

**You have +1 Reputation** with a powerful figure — a corporate magnate, a mafia don, or a government ghost. They pull strings for you when you ask… but they've also got leverage.

**You screwed someone over** and they are angry. Get a -1 Reputation with a small group of your choosing (can work it out with the GM), but you start with Cash Tier +1 (Flush) and 1 influence

### Signature Ability – Dimensional Incursion

Spend 3 Preparation dice to step through the seams of reality into a nearby alternate version of Haven. Describe to your GM where you are jumping to. Maybe a factory that was never condemned, a rubdown house that is a pharmacy, a door that exists only in another world. You can use this to bypass obstacles, retrieve something that exists in that other reality, or evade danger entirely. The effect is fleeting and cannot rewrite events and after you return, the incursion is closed and cannot haunt you, most of the time. Whatever you do, it must be in dimensions.

### All According to the Plan

Once per session, declare this phrase before rolling. You add +2 dice to your roll (from outside of the game) as the threads of preparation and probability snap perfectly into place. Any exhausted die you roll are not lost — instead, they are returned to the Preparation Pool, fueling future plans. If the rolled dice didn't roll any 1's gain an Influence.

### That, and then

Your instincts bend causality itself. When you succeed at an action, you may spend 1 Influence to immediately take another action as if you had planned it all along. If you succeed on the second action you may add a die to the preparation pool.

### From Any Direction

Your connection to overlapping dimensions lets you manipulate angles and trajectories in ways that defy geometry. When making a ranged attack or throwing an object, you can declare it comes from an impossible direction — a reflection, a corner, or behind a barrier. The attack is a success on 5–6 instead of 6. Once per session you may use this ability for free, but each subsequent use costs one Luck.

### Split Decision

When cornered or under pressure, you can exist in two possible outcomes for an instant. Describe both actions — for example, grabbing an item and running, attacking and evading. Roll only one stat roll, even if the actions would normally require two separate rolls; on a 6, both occur (you merge back into one being at the end of the action). On 4-5 choose one of the options that happened. Add one dice to the [[Core-Rules#chaos-pool|Chaos Pool]].

## Haunted One

You're never alone — not truly. There's a spirit that walks beside you, unseen by most and half-remembered by all. It hums in dead radios, leaves fog on mirrors, and sometimes borrows your voice when you're not paying attention. You may not know what binds you together, or maybe you had a tragedy happen to you. Maybe it's unfinished business, or a promise neither of you can keep. Maybe it's just chance — a collision between the living and whatever waits beyond. But since the day it found you, the world has seemed thinner, and people tend to look right through you, as if you only half-exist.

**You gain +1 to Willpower and +2 to any other two stats.**

### Starting Cash
Tier 2 (Scraping By): Work's hard to keep when lights flicker and voices whisper wherever you go. People avoid you, jobs don't last, and you live where no one asks questions. You have a small apartment and a small trinket you use to communicate with the spirits, small radio, a tape recorder or a handheld mirror.

### Reputation options

**You killed someone** (or they died because of you). You're technically a free person, but the Haven PD always has their eye on you. -1 Rep with Haven PD. But someone, for their own reasons knows you and will help you if needed.

**Ghosts recognize you as kin**, they whisper your name with curiosity and respect. +1 Rep with Ghosts & Spirits, but the spirit that haunts you might get jealous.

### Signature ability – Ghost in the Wires

By spending 3 dice from the Preparation Pool, you may command your ghostly companion to possess an object — or, if you dare, something once living. For a short time, you gain complete control over it: a car drives itself, a camera rewinds its footage, or a corpse shuffle to your side, waiting for orders. The spirit acts through your intent but with its own eerie touch, lights dim, metal warps, and static hums in the air. Whatever you do, think in terms of ghosts or possessions.

### Summon the Departed

Your spirit can call to others trapped between echoes. You may attempt to summon or contact a ghost of someone recently dead — their cooperation is not guaranteed. Before rolling, exhaust 1 Mental die from your pool. Roll Willpower, depending on the success, the spirit may or may not cooperate, but is always summoned. Ghosts rarely appear in spirit, but will answer over the technology.

### Misery Loves Company

When you fail a roll against an opponent (attack, chase, contest), you may spend 1 Influence to drag them down with you. Their action automatically fails as well — a flickering light, a sudden chill, a whispered distraction. Then, add 1 die to the Preparation Pool, plus any dice you exhausted from the roll.

### Obscuring Aura

People's eyes slide off you, and cameras glitch when you pass. When rolling Agility to hide, sneak, or avoid notice, count 5–6 as a success instead of only 6. Once per session you may use this ability for free, but each subsequent use costs one Luck. Timid Demons and Spirits are strangely attracted and friendly to you.

### Shared Perception

Spend one preparation die to see through your spirit's eyes. You observe your ghosts' surroundings as if you were at its location. (Gm can ask for Intellect roll). Your spirit is mostly obedient in this situation and you can send him to scout.
