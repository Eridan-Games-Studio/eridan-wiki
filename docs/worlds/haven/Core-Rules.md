## The Dice System

H.A.V.E.N. uses six-sided dice pool (d6).

When you roll, you create a dice pool based on your character's stats and bonuses.

### Rolling Dice

1. Choose the most relevant [Attribute](#attributes) for the action (e.g. Agility, Intellect).
2. Roll up to your Attribute value number of dice (your choice how many, but usually will roll the max number).
3. Take the highest single die rolled.

| Result | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| 6 | Full success — you achieve your goal cleanly. |
| 5–4 | Partial success — you succeed, but with cost, delay, or complication. |
| 3–1 | Failure — the situation worsens or backfires. |
| Any 1 rolled | One die is exhausted — removed from your pool until recovered. |

#### Example:

You're sneaking past a guard. Your Agility is 3, so you roll up to 3 dice. You choose to roll all 3 and get 5, 3, 1.

The 5 means you succeed — but not perfectly. Maybe you drop something, or the guard notices something's off.

The 1 means one of your dice becomes exhausted — you're getting tired, or luck's slipping.

## Character Overview

Every character in H.A.V.E.N. has two core aspects:

- **Who you are** — your [Calling](worlds/haven/Callings.md), background, beliefs, and secrets.
- **What you can do** — your Attributes, abilities, and resources.

---

## Attributes

Attributes determine your character's physical and mental capability. They're grouped into two Dice Pools:

### Physical Pool

- **Brawn**: Strength, melee combat, physical force.
- **Agility**: Dexterity, reflex, coordination.
- **Endurance**: Toughness, stamina, survival.

### Mental Pool

- **Intellect**: Logic, reasoning, perception, research.
- **Charisma**: Charm, deception, presence.
- **Willpower**: Focus, mental resistance, determination.

At [character creation](worlds/haven/Character-Creation.md):

- All Attributes start at 1.
- Distribute +5 additional points as you choose in each pool (10 total).
- Your [Calling](worlds/haven/Callings.md) may grant further bonuses.

Your Physical Pool is the total of Brawn + Agility + Endurance.

Your Mental Pool is Intellect + Charisma + Willpower.

## Core Systems

### Exhaustion, Stamina & Recovery

Each die you lose to exhaustion represents strain.

You can recover dice by:

- **Taking a Breather** — recover dice equal to your Stamina and Recovery stat.
- **Spending Downtime** — recover all dice. Your maximum can be lowered by wounds.

If your Physical or Mental Pool drops to 0, you're incapacitated for the scene. When the scene is over you get a free Breather action that gets you up.

### Preparation Pool

The Preparation Pool represents how ready the group is for the mission — the notes, plans, backup gear, and lucky coincidences that pay off later.

- The pool begins with 1 die at the start of a session if empty.
- It grows when players make clever preparations or discover useful intel.
- Anyone can spend from it to add dice to their roll — even beyond their stat limit.
- Dice from the pool ignore exhaustion (1s don't remove dice). Each die ignores 1 exhausted die.
- Players can spend 1-2 dice to make a retroactive statement. (GM decides on cost)
- The pool empties at the end of the successful mission.

#### Example:

The crew researched the factory blueprints before heading in — the GM adds +2 dice to the Preparation Pool.

Later, the Agent spends one die to add to his stealth agility roll and removes that die from the pool after the roll. Or, Private Investigator uses 2 dice to make a retroactive statement. "Earlier this day, I patrolled this area and hid a gun behind the old dumpster"

### Chaos Pool

The Chaos Pool represents Haven's will — the city's unpredictable pulse.

The GM adds 1 Chaos die when:

- The players escalate conflict or make a risky choice.
- Paranormal energy stirs.
- Time drags on in tension or fear.
- Someone fails in a way that feels costly.

At 5 dice, the GM rolls them all.

The result shapes the next turn of events:

| Pattern | Outcome |
|---------|---------|
| Pair | Strange omen or small setback. |
| Two Pairs / Three of a Kind | Complication or interference. |
| Full House / Four of a Kind | Major turn — a faction acts, or a haunting worsens. |
| Five of a Kind | Catastrophe — the city bites back. Reality bends. |

After resolving, the pool resets to 0.

#### Example:

The team sets fire to a cult hideout to escape.

The GM adds a Chaos die — the act will draw attention.

By the end of the night, the pool hits five dice.

A roll shows Three of a Kind — now, the Haven PD shows up, tipped off by an anonymous caller. The loose description of the party was given to the Haven PD.

### Luck

Luck is personal, strange, and unreliable.

You gain Luck for daring acts, clever roleplay, or narrative twists.

- Spend 1 Luck to reroll any 1 die.
- Make a Luck Roll by rolling any number of Luck points as dice. Success (6) means you are extremely lucky, a you triumph against all odds; (4-5) you make it barely, but with some nasty side effect. (1-3) failure means fate turns against you and consequences are severe.

#### Example:

The Haunted One fires their last shot at the fleeing cultist. They miss — but spend a Luck point to reroll. The die lands on 6.

The bullet ricochets off a street sign and hits the cultist's arm. Luck at work.

### Influence

Influence is your social and political weight, but also your will and experience in the city. And maybe most importantly, your will and grit against the hungering beast of the City. The city itself reacts to your influence and actions.

Spend it to:

- Spend 1 Influence to add a story details ("I know a guy in maintenance.")
- Activate [Calling abilities](worlds/haven/Callings.md).

Influence is earned for completing missions, playing your Conviction, pulling off dramatic successes, or shifting faction politics.

### Reputation

Reputation reflects your standing with Haven's factions.

Positive rep (+1) earns favors and access.

Negative rep (–1) brings suspicion, higher prices, or danger.

When you are dealing with a +1 faction or operating on their territory you add two prep die to the Preparation pool. Those die represent advantage and support from the group that you have a good standing with.

When You are dealing with a -1 faction or operation on their territory GM adds one die to the Chaos pool immediately. If you find yourself in unfavorable conditions, GM can remove one or two dice from the preparation pool.

Reputation naturally changes based on player actions.

It can also be traded for mechanical advantage — a temporary sacrifice of goodwill for immediate benefit.

### Health, Wounds, and Consequences

When hurt, mark a Wound that reduces your effective dice pool. Wounds received are narrative and GM decides the tier of the wound. You can have multiple wounds lowering your pool.

- A **Minor Wound (1)** reduces a pool by 1.
- A **Moderate Wound (2)** reduces a pool by 2.
- A **Severe Wound (3)** reduces a pool by 3.

At 0 dice, you're incapacitated. You don't die unless the story calls for it — but the cost of survival can be steep. When the current scene is finished (combat, chase, investigation) you get a free Breather action and are back in action, although exhausted.

#### Healing:

Wounds recover slowly:

- Minor wounds heal after a night's rest.
- Moderate and severe wounds recover 1 tier per day with medical care.
- Healing costs vary on you Cash Tier and other players can pay for your bills.

### Cash & Economy

Money in Haven isn't tracked in coins — it's tracked in comfort.

Your Cash Tier reflects lifestyle, access, and leverage.

| Tier | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Broke | You owe, beg, or steal. |
| 2 | Scraping By | Enough to live, not enough to rest. |
| 3 | Comfortable | Room to breathe; a little luxury. |
| 4 | Well-Off | Connections and options. |
| 5 | Loaded | You can buy silence. |

Cash Tiers rise and fall as you complete missions or indulge vices.

You can raise your Cash Tier by Completing jobs, Gambling, extortion, faction support, etc.

You will lose your Cash Tier by Vices, Helping others, Bribes and Payoffs, Repairs, Bad Luck.

**Medical expenses**: Each Tier in Cash has its own value when paying for medical expenses. The amount of care you can pay is your Cash tier -1. So, a broke character cannot pay for expenses, while Comfortable character can lower his tier by one to lower two Wound Tiers. Remember, tier one wounds do not require medical care.

## Missions and Downtime

### Missions

Each mission is a case — a single story arc with an objective.

The GM sets the tone, obstacles, and opportunities, while players decide how to approach it.

**Phases of a Mission:**

1. **Hook**: What brings you in.
2. **Preparation**: Research, planning, and adding dice to the Preparation Pool.
3. **The Job**: The action — investigation, confrontation, infiltration.
4. **Climax**: Resolution or disaster.
5. **Aftermath**: Debrief, consequences, payments.

### Downtime

Between missions, players can:

- Recover and heal wounds.
- Research and gather intel
- Relax and roleplay.
- Any kind of low stakes activity

Downtime has no strict limit — players decide when they're ready for the next job, but some jobs might need urgency to be successful.
