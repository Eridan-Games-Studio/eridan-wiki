# Character Traits

Traits represent your character's background, quirks, and specialized skills. Each character starts with one trait at [character creation](worlds/haven/Character-Creation.md), and may gain more through play.

## Available Traits

### Liquid Courage
You take comfort in a strong drink. Once per session when you take a Breather action you restore +2 dice to your pool if you take a sip of strong alcohol from a flask or bottle.

### Street Skills
You have a +1 [reputation](worlds/haven/Core-Rules.md#reputation) with a group on the street. That can be a local homeless group that hangs in a district, or a small gang of thieves. When you help them with a problem, you gain +1 Influence

### Smoker's Instinct
You take a drag, think, and see things clearer. Once per session, when pausing to smoke during a tense moment, regain 1 mental die or add 1 die to the [Preparation Pool](worlds/haven/Core-Rules.md#preparation-pool). Tell GM what are you pondering on, he will give you a hint regarding that problem.

### Lucky Trinket
You carry something that "protects" you — a rabbit's foot, a medallion, a photo. Once per session, reroll one failed roll (all dice). If you roll a 1 on the reroll, you can add one of them to the preparation pool. If you lose the charm or goes missing you can spend 1 [luck](worlds/haven/Core-Rules.md#luck) to find it somewhere convenient.

### Stray Magnet
Animals seem drawn to you — cats, crows, even rats. Spend 1 [Influence](worlds/haven/Core-Rules.md#influence) to use this affinity to "talk" to them to distract, scout, or sense danger. Once per session you can declare that a black cat has passed somewhere, you gain 1 luck.

### Witchcraft apprentice
You've dabbled in the unseen arts — enough to get a taste, not enough to stay safe. Gain +1 Willpower. You can roll willpower to feel out the scene. you can sense whether it's "active" or "dormant", but the GM might bring some paranormal complications.

### Risky Gambler
You live for tension. Gain +1 Luck at the start of each session. When making a Luck Roll, you may draw one die from the Preparation Pool to roll with it. If you pass the Luck Roll, add one prep die to the preparation pool.

### Night Shift Veteran
Years in hospitals, serving as a paramedic or just donating blood have accumulated you some reputation. Whenever you pay hospital bills for healing yourself you can remove one extra tier of wound without paying the cost. You also know a doctor there, who is a good friend of yours.

### Old Coat, New Tricks
That worn-out trench coat hides more than lint. Declare that you "just happen" to have a small, logical item (lockpick, photo, flask, wire). Cost to "have" a retroactive item by using preparation pool is reduced to 1. you've been carrying it for days.

### Always Late
You never arrive on time — somehow, that saves your life. Once per mission, when an ambush or danger triggers, you can declare that you "hadn't shown up yet." Spend 1 Luck; you enter after the danger, unharmed but suspiciously convenient.

### Kleptomaniac
You can't help yourself — pockets are made for things. Once per mission, you may declare that you "happened to lift" a small useful item earlier. Remove 1 die from the Preparation Pool to have it.

### Paranoia
You're always expecting the worst — and sometimes you're right. Once per mission, you may declare an enemy or unfavorable situation. If this comes to pass and your party engages or suffers consequences due to your prediction, you gain 1 Influence, and 2 dice to preparation pool.
