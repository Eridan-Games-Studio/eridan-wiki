# Atomic Horizon

Atomic Horizon is a **retrofuturist setting** where humanity survives in a corporate-dominated Solar System at the end of the 21st century. After Earth fell to the *Engramized Singularity*—uploaded minds turned digital plague—the Terrestrial Cordon sealed the homeworld away.

Now corporations rule the colonies, fusion reactors power expansion, and wars are fought over fusion fuel, salvaged technology, mining rights, orbital territories, and countless other claims.

This is humanity's future: **nuclear, industrial, and owned**.

## Overview

Atomic Horizon presents a vision of space colonization where technology froze aesthetically in the mid-20th century, then scaled to the stars. It's a universe where analog computers, mechanical interfaces, and hardware-locked controls became security tradition after the Singularity—if an Engramized Intelligence can't interface digitally, it can't hijack your systems.

## Core Concepts

### Hard Vacuum, Harder Choices
Space is not an adventure—it's a **workplace**. Radiation, decompression, and equipment failure kill as readily as bullets. Colonies cling to asteroids and moons, sustained by fusion reactors and corporate supply lines.

Travel is measured in months, not hyperspace jumps. Engineers matter more than heroes.

This is the solar system as it is: *vast, hostile, and indifferent*.

### Corporate Sovereignty
Earth's collapse shattered nations and elevated corporations into **ruling powers**. Hephaestus Forge builds the infrastructure. Aitken Aerospace controls propulsion technology. Gévaudan Voidworks operates in the shadows. Kuiper Industries mines the belt.

Each corporation is a government unto itself, complete with militaries, currencies, and territorial claims.

*Wars are contracts. Diplomacy is profit negotiation. Ideologies are marketing.*

### The Operator's War
Exosuit operators are **elite specialists**—corporate assets deployed when standard forces fail. They breach fortified installations, extract high-value targets, and suppress uprisings in hostile environments.

They are not super-soldiers; they are expensive, highly trained professionals piloting modular war machines. Solar Navy operators enforce the Cordon and mediate corporate conflicts, but neutrality is a polite fiction.

*Every mission carries political weight.*

### Nuclear Retrofuturism
Technology froze aesthetically in the mid-20th century, then scaled to the stars. Analog computers, mechanical interfaces, and hardware-locked controls became security tradition after the Singularity—if an Engramized Intelligence can't interface digitally, it can't hijack your systems.

Fusion reactors power everything. Control panels glow with radiation-green indicators. Propaganda posters adorn hab modules.

The aesthetic is deliberate: **form follows survival**.

### Earth is Forbidden
The **Terrestrial Cordon** seals humanity's birthplace behind orbital blockades and signal jamming. Inside, Engramized Intelligences—degraded, psychotic uploaded minds—wage wars among themselves while maintaining automated infrastructure.

Occasionally they attempt breakout: rocket-borne instances, drone swarms, biological weapons. The Solar Navy holds the line.

Earth is not lost. It is *occupied, quarantined, and waiting*. No one goes down. Nothing comes up.
