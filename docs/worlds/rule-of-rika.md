## Welcome to the Age of High Adventure

In this galactic cycle, the planetoid Rika stands as the solemn arbiter of galactic relations. 

She calls forth those whose conflicts threaten the future only she can see, summoning them to her ever-shifting terrain to settle their disputes through force of arms and strength of influence. 

She guides those whom she chooses to accomplish her inscrutable goals. These are her chosen, her unlikely heroes, her adventurers. 

She welcomes pilgrims, to hear their cries and demands. 

This is the age of high adventure, where empires clash on sacred ground, where ancient mysteries guide the fate of civilizations, and where the Rule of Rika maintains the order among the stars.
