## Welcome to the Age of High Adventure

In this galactic cycle, the planetoid Rika stands as the solemn arbiter of galactic relations. 

She calls forth those whose conflicts threaten the future only she can see, summoning them to her ever-shifting terrain to settle their disputes through force of arms and strength of influence. 

She guides those whom she chooses to accomplish her inscrutable goals. These are her chosen, her unlikely heroes, her adventurers. 

She welcomes pilgrims, to hear their cries and demands. 

This is the age of high adventure, where empires clash on sacred ground, where ancient mysteries guide the fate of civilizations, and where the Rule of Rika maintains the order among the stars.

## Understanding Rika

### The Call
When conflicts threaten galactic stability, Rika sends forth **The Call**â€”a broadcast summoning the disputing parties to her surface. To ignore it invites escalating cosmic disasters: rogue comets, stellar instability, planetary catastrophes, and ultimately, total annihilation.

[â†’ Learn more about The Call](systems/the-call)

### The Pilgrimage
Emissaries journey to Rika's central plateau, proclaim their cause before the obsidian pillar, and offer soil and blood. The altar reveals the date and coordinates where their dispute will be settled through combat and influence.

[â†’ Learn more about The Pilgrimage](systems/the-pilgrimage)

### The Judgment
Rika's decisions are binding. Victory grants legitimacy. Defeat brings consequences. And those who challenge her authority without the ancient right... become cautionary tales whispered across the stars.

Those who exist outside Rika's established order:

## Key Concepts

### Galactic Cycles
The universe operates in recurring epochs, each defined by the rise and fall of civilizations. The current cycle, now twelve galactic cycles old, is governed by Rika's authority.

### The Mantle of Great Race
A designation achieved through fulfilling ancient rites, such as the Zo Har's successful claim via the rite of Holmgang.

### Ascension
The ultimate goal of civilizationsâ€”to transcend mortality and join the ranks of the godlike Guardians who shaped the universe.
